Dr. Wood: After a coronary-artery dissection has been identified on coronary angiography, a conservative approach is typically warranted, particu-larly in the presence of preserved distal perfusion. Placement of a guidewire for percutaneous coronary intervention can be technically difficult and can lead to abrupt vessel closure or propagation of the dissection.12
Currently, few data support the use of antiatherosclerotic medications in the management of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection. Most experienced clinicians support the use of lowdose aspirin (80 to 100 mg daily) in all patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and the use of dual antiplatelet therapy in those who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention; thrombolytic therapy, long-term therapy with heparin, and therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are otherwise typically avoided. Betablockers and angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors may be used selectively in patients with ongoing angina or heart failure.12,13 Statin therapy is not typically used for the treatment of spontaneous coronary-artery dissection but may be initiated in patients who have other indications.
Patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection are usually referred for cardiac rehabilitation. Unique cardiac-rehabilitation programs have been designed for this typically fit, young group of patients.14 Because there is a frequent association between spontaneous coronary-artery dissection and fibromuscular dysplasia, CT angiography of the head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended. Genetic testing may be performed when there is a family history of possible connective-tissue disorders or evidence of connective-tissue disorders on physical examination or vascular screening; it may also be performed at the patient’s request.11-13 Given the features of this patient’s presentation and the family history of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, we obtained additional imaging studies to rule out fibromuscular dysplasia and performed a genetic evaluation to determine whether an underlying genetic condition could explain her diagnosis.
