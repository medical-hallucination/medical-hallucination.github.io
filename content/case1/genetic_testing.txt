Dr. Mark E. Lindsay: It is common to perform a genetic evaluation in patients with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection because of the frequent absence of traditional cardiac risk factors in such patients and because of the known association of arterial dissection with genetic disorders. Genetic diagnoses associated with spontaneous coronary-artery dissection include Marfan’s syndrome, the Loeys–Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and probably others.10,15-18 In this case, the family history of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome further motivated the genetic evaluation. In general, the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is not associated with vascular features; however vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (type 4), which is caused by disruption of the gene COL3A1,19 is associated with nonaneurysmal arterial dissections.20 Therefore, a primary goal of the genetic evaluation in this case was to discriminate specifically between a COL3A1– associated syndrome and nonvascular types of the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
Three first-degree family members had the Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, with symptoms including joint dislocations and hypermobility. However, the patient did not have joint dysfunction or objective hypermobility (i.e., she had a score of 0 on the Beighton scale of hypermobility, which ranges from 0 to 9, with a score >4 indicating generalized flexibility).21 There was no family history of arterial dissection, hollow viscus rupture, sudden death, or emergency vascular surgery. In short, the family history was only superficially suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, and the patient did not appear to be affected by the familial joint condition. The ab-sence of proximal aortic enlargement and the presence of noncystic kidneys on imaging studies in this patient reduced the likelihood of Marfan’s syndrome, the Loeys–Dietz syndrome, or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. A further consideration in this case was the absence of fibromuscular dysplasia. Monogenic vascular syndromes have not been found to be associated with a vascular morphology that is characteristic of fibromuscular dysplasia22,23; therefore, the absence of fibromuscular dysplasia in this case somewhat increases the probability of an identifiable genetic disorder.
Neither the examination nor the family history was suggestive of vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, but external inspection alone cannot completely rule out this diagnosis, and the abnormalities of the renal arteries suggested a widespread arteriopathy. Given the patient’s risk profile and her desire to assess familial risk, we recommended molecular genetic testing. After formal genetic counseling was provided and written informed consent was obtained, a blood sample was obtained for testing with a comprehensive panel of genes associated with aortopathy. The testing included sequencing and deletion and duplication analysis of 23 genes reportedly involved in arterial disease, including COL3A1
(associated with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome), FBN1 (associated with Marfan’s syndrome), and TGFBR2 and SMAD3 (associated with the Loeys–Dietz syndrome).10,15-17 The test results, which were returned 2 weeks later, were negative. Given this patient’s negative family history, unrevealing physical examination, and negative genetic testing, the possibility of a described mendelian vascular condition appears to be unlikely.
Dr. Wood: On follow-up treadmill stress testing 6 weeks after presentation, the patient was able to exercise for 9 minutes. There were no diagnostic changes on electrocardiography, and she did not have chest pain. Since the time of the follow-up evaluation, she has had fleeting episodes of intermittent chest pain but no prolonged episodes. She exercises daily, feels well overall, and continues to receive a low-dose betablocker, aspirin, and isosorbide mononitrate.
