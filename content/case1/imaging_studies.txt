Dr. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head, neck, abdomen, and pelvis was performed to evaluate for abnormalities of small and medium-sized vessels. The vessels in the head and neck were patent and had no evidence of aneurysm, dissection, or luminal irregularity, such as beading.

The arterial-phase abdominal images were slightly confounded by motion, but delayed-phase images showed multiple small, bilateral, wedge-shaped cortical defects that were consistent with remote renal infarctions (Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B). On arterial-phase abdominal and pelvic images, paired right and single left renal arteries were identified, all of which had subtle luminal irregularities (Fig. 3C and Fig. 3D), findings consistent with previous renal-artery dissections. However, there were no findings that would specifically suggest fibromuscular dysplasia, such as beading, stenosis, or aneurysm.
