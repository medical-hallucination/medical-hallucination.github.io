## Benign Renal Tumor

Oncocytoma is the most common tumor that mimics renal cancer. On imaging, the features of oncocytoma are typically homogeneous and include a classic central scar that correlates histologically with fibrosis. In this patient, the heterogeneity of the mass on CT is not consistent with this diagnosis.

Leiomyoma develops in the kidney when growth of smooth muscle occurs. However, renal leiomyoma is typically located in the capsule of the kidney, is usually small, and does not grow rapidly. Metanephric adenoma is an embryologic anomaly that may persist over time but is rare in adults. In this case, the development of a varicocele was probably a clue that the renal mass was growing rapidly, at a rate that is too rapid for the mass to be metanephric adenoma.

Angiomyolipoma is a renal hamartoma, with a mixture of blood vessels, muscle cells, and fat cells. Angiomyolipoma is one of the few renal masses that contain fat, and the fat is usually obvious on either CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Some variants of angiomyolipoma contain very little fat and cannot be easily distinguished from renal cancer on the basis of characteristics on imaging alone. However, this tumor is more common in women than men and is slow-growing, and it would be unusual for the tumor to be as large as the tumor was in this patient at his age.

This patient presented with a fast-growing renal mass, and I suspect that the development of the varicocele probably reflects the speed of growth of his tumor. Given his age and the features of his presentation, a benign renal tumor is unlikely.
