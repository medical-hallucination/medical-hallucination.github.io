## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Douglas M. Dahl: This healthy 29-year-old man presented with a large mass at the lower pole of the right kidney, which had been incidentally discovered during an evaluation of a testicular mass. He appeared to be well and had not had any systemic symptoms; these features of his presentation support a localized rather than systemic process. Results of a laboratory evaluation - including the white-cell count, hemoglobin level, and results of tests of renal function and liver function - were normal, findings that argue against a systemic inflammatory or infectious process. The urinalysis was negative for red cells, thus ruling out bleeding from the mass into the urinary tract. To develop a differential diagnosis, I will focus on the large mass, which was presumably of renal origin, but I will also address whether the testicular findings may have been related to the mass.

The most common solid tumor among men of this patient's age is testicular cancer. Whenever a retroperitoneal mass is identified in a young man, metastasis from testicular cancer must be ruled out, because primary renal cancer would be very unusual in a young patient. Testing for serum tumor markers of testicular cancer would typically be performed in a young man with any kind of testicular mass, but the imaging studies in this case were so suggestive of a primary renal mass that retroperitoneal spread of a testicular cancer seems very unlikely.
