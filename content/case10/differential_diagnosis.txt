## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Douglas M. Dahl: This healthy 29-year-old man presented with a large mass at the lower pole of the right kidney, which had been incidentally discovered during an evaluation of a testicular mass. He appeared to be well and had not had any systemic symptoms, indicating a localized process rather than a systemic one. Results of a laboratory evaluation — including the white-cell count, hemoglobin level, and results of tests of renal function and liver function — were all normal, arguing against a systemic inflammatory or infectious process. The urinalysis was negative for red cells, ruling out bleeding from the mass into the urinary tract. To develop a differential diagnosis, I will focus on the large mass, presumably of renal origin, but I will also address whether the testicular findings may have been related to the mass.

The most common solid tumor among men of this patient's age is testicular cancer. Whenever a retroperitoneal mass is identified in a young man, metastasis from testicular cancer must be ruled out, as primary renal cancer is unusual in young patients. Testing for serum tumor markers of testicular cancer is typically performed in a young man with any testicular mass. However, the imaging studies in this case were suggestive of a primary renal mass, making retroperitoneal spread of testicular cancer seem unlikely.
