## Inflammatory Or Infectious Mass

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause large renal masses and mimic renal cancer on imaging. It is almost always associated with some degree of chronic obstruction of the kidney, which is manifested by hydronephrosis. Renal stones and prominent calcification are also often present. Some calcification was seen on imaging in this patient, but the calcification was sparse and located just at the rim of the lesion and thus was not consistent with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

Another potential clue to consider is that this patient was originally from South America. We are not told whether he had ever been exposed to tuberculosis, which can cause masslike lesions in the kidney. Renal tuberculosis is usually part of a systemic infection that is characterized by fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Similar to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, tuberculosis is associated with chronic inflammation that causes obstruction of the kidney by infundibular or ureteral stenosis. There was no evidence of these findings in this patient.

Echinococcal infection that is caused by Echinococcus granulosus or *E. multilocularis*, parasitic tapeworms that are endemic in certain parts of South America, should also be considered in our differential diagnosis. Echinococcus is most commonly associated with liver or lung disease, but cases associated with isolated renal masses that mimic renal carcinoma have been reported. Although this diagnosis cannot be ruled out with the information we have, it would be an unusual and unlikely diagnosis in this case.
