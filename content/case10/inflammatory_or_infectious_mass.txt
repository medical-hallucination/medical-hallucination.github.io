## Inflammatory or Infectious Mass

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause large renal masses and mimic renal cancer on imaging. It is generally associated with some degree of chronic obstruction of the kidney, which is manifested by hydronephrosis. Renal stones and prominent calcification are often present. In this case, some calcification was observed, but it was sparse and located at the rim of the lesion, which is not consistent with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

Additionally, this patient was originally from South America. There is no information about exposure to tuberculosis, a systemic infection that can cause kidney lesions characterized by fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Tuberculosis is usually associated with chronic inflammation causing obstruction, but these findings were absent in this patient.

Echinococcal infection, caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* or *E. multilocularis*, endemic tapeworms in parts of South America, should be considered. Though typically associated with liver or lung disease, renal masses mimicking carcinoma have been reported. Nonetheless, this remains an unlikely diagnosis in this case.
