## Spermatocele

The patient also had a cyst on the right side of the epididymal head. This is a common intrascrotal finding and is probably a spermatocele. A spermatocele is a cystic dilatation of the epididymal tubes, and it contains spermatozoa. It most commonly occurs at the head of the epididymis, adjacent to the superior pole of the testis. In rare cases, the spermatocele is associated with congenital renal cystic anomalies, because of the common embryonic mesodermal origin of the kidneys and epididymis. In such cases, the spermatocele is usually associated with multiple cystic changes, so the solitary, small spermatocele in this patient is unlikely to be related to the renal mass.

Patients with the von Hippel–Lindau syndrome may present with renal and paratesticular masses. However, cystadenoma, a predominantly solid mass in the epididymis, develops in these patients. This patient did not present with any other features of the von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, such as multiple renal cancers that develop by the third decade of life, cysts in the pancreas or kidneys, or retinal, spinal, or cerebellar abnormalities.
