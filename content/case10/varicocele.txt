## Varicocele

This patient had a varicocele on the left side, which is common in men. A varicocele is a chronic dilatation of veins around the testes that develops because the gonadal veins that drain from the testicle to the upper retroperitoneum lack internal valves. A varicocele on the right side is uncommon, because the angle of insertion of the right gonadal vein into the vena cava causes a functional valve effect, so the venous pressures generally remain low. However, the development of an acute varicocele, although rare, is sometimes a clue to compression of the vena cava or impediment of blood flow in the gonadal vein. If an acute varicocele occurs on the right side, it suggests a retroperitoneal process and would raise concerns about testicular cancer. The finding of a varicocele on the left side in this patient with a large mass in the right retroperitoneum does not provide us with any clues in this case.
