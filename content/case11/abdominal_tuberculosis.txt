## Abdominal Tuberculosis

Could this patient have abdominal tuberculosis? Abdominal tuberculosis accounts for approximately 5% of all cases of tuberculosis and is one of the most common forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The clinical symptoms are varied and often protean. The ileocecal region is the most frequently affected intestinal site. However, tuberculosis is less likely than other infections to be associated with eosinophilia. Additionally, the lymphadenopathy associated with abdominal tuberculosis is often massive, and such lymphadenopathy was not seen in this patient. Finally, examination of the colonic biopsy specimen did not reveal caseous necrosis or confluent granulomas. Therefore, other potential explanations for this patient's colonic mass and eosinophilia must be considered.
