## Angiostrongylus

Angiostrongyliasis is caused by two species of nematodes. *Angiostrongylus costaricensis* is found in Central America, including Guatemala. Humans are incidental hosts that can become infected by consuming intermediate or transport hosts, such as snails, slugs, freshwater crabs, or shrimp. This invasive helminth migrates to the ileocecal region and releases eggs into the intestinal wall, causing inflammation, sometimes mass lesions, and often a peripheral eosinophilia.11,12 This patient's exposure to freshwater crayfish and shrimp in Guatemala raises concerns about angiostrongyliasis.
