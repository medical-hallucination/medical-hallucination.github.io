## Cancer

Cancer can be associated with eosinophilia. Myeloid cancer is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's eosinophilia, as clonal eosinophilias typically coincide with leukocytosis and a higher eosinophil count than observed here. While lymphoma and solid tumors could still be potential factors for this patient's colonic mass, the biopsy findings did not support a cancer diagnosis. Given the patient's background from Guatemala, it's crucial to also consider parasitic infections that can lead to eosinophilia and mass lesions in the intestine.
