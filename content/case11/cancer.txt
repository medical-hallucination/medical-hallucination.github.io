## Cancer

Cancer can be associated with eosinophilia. Myeloid cancer is an unlikely cause of this patient's eosinophilia, since clonal eosinophilias are often associated with leukocytosis and a higher absolute eosinophil count than was seen in this case. Lymphoma and solid tumors remain possible in this patient with a colonic mass. However, given that examination of the colonic biopsy specimen did not reveal findings consistent with cancer and that the patient was from Guatemala, we must also consider certain parasitic infections that can cause eosinophilia and an intestinal mass lesion.
