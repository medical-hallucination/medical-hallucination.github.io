## Colonoscopy and Histopathologic Examination

Dr. Kyle Staller: The patient was referred for expedited colonoscopy. During the procedure, sessile polyps, measuring 3 mm in diameter, were detected in the sigmoid colon and the descending colon. The polyps were removed by cold snare polypectomy. There was an infiltrative noncircumferential, nonobstructing mass in the ascending colon, along with scant bleeding. Biopsy specimens of the mass were obtained.

Figure 2. Photographs Obtained during Colonoscopy. During colonoscopy, sessile polyps, measuring 3 mm in diameter, were visible in the sigmoid colon (Panel A) and the descending colon (Panel B). A noncircumferential, nonobstructing mass with rolled borders and an ulcerated base was visible in the ascending colon (Panels C, D, and E).

Dr. Vikram Deshpande: Histologic evaluation of the resected polyps showed tubular adenomas. Histologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens of the mass revealed ulcerated mucosa with extensive granulation tissue, acute and chronic inflammation, and reactive changes, including numerous plasma cells and histiocytes.

Dr. Henderson-Frost: Based on the colonoscopy results, a carcinoembryonic antigen level was obtained, which was 2.2 ng per milliliter (reference range, <3.4). A diagnosis was made.
