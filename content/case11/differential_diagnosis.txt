## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Anna K. Rubin: This 66-year-old woman from Guatemala presented to the community health center with facial pain and was treated presumably for temporomandibular joint dysfunction, with resolution of her symptoms. In accordance with recommended care for new immigrant or refugee patients, routine vaccinations and screening tests were offered, including age-appropriate screening for breast and colon cancer and testing for *M. tuberculosis* infection. An interferon-Î³ release assay for *M. tuberculosis* was positive, and chest radiography did not reveal evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. When the patient returned to the clinic to discuss treatment options for latent tuberculosis infection, she reported a 2-month history of pain in the right side of the abdomen that was distinct from the chronic abdominal pain that she had had for approximately 30 years. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed; this was a reasonable next diagnostic step in a patient older than 50 years of age with more weight loss than expected and infectious exposures. The imaging studies revealed a mass in the ascending colon, which was confirmed on colonoscopy. Although the most common cause of a colonic mass is colon cancer, examination of the colonic biopsy specimen did not reveal findings consistent with cancer; however, colonic biopsy has a negative predictive value of only 60%, and the results are not sufficient to rule out a diagnosis of cancer.1 Since colon cancer is a diagnosis that must not be missed, I will keep this condition high on my differential diagnosis. Although colon cancer is a major concern in this case, I will focus on other causes of a colonic mass, as well. I will use key laboratory findings, including eosinophilia, and the patient's rich exposure history to construct a differential diagnosis that I hope will lead us to the most likely diagnosis.
