## Next Steps

Helminth infection is considered the likely cause of this patient's eosinophilia and colonic mass. However, colon cancer cannot be overlooked as it is a serious concern. Surgical excision of the mass is recommended as the next diagnostic step to rule out cancer definitively, with the hope that a helminthic infection will instead be identified. 

Dr. Meridale Baggett (Medicine): Dr. Staller, what were your thoughts when you first saw this patient?

Dr. Staller: During the colonoscopy performed to evaluate the suspicious lesion seen on the CT scan of the abdomen, I observed an ulcerated mass in the ascending colon. This patient's broad differential diagnosis included infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders, and cancer. Given the patient's Central American origin, eosinophilia, and ulcerated colonic lesion, we considered strongyloidiasis and amebiasis. The lesion's placement on the right side also suggested a colonic infection with *M. tuberculosis*. NSAID use can result in well-demarcated ulcers throughout the gastrointestinal tract, which is consistent with the lesion observed in this patient. However, the lesion's appearance was also indicative of cancer, such as primary colonic adenocarcinoma or colonic lymphoma.

We had to choose between tissue sampling only or removing the mass. While removal could offer curative treatment for benign and early cancerous lesions, trying to remove advanced lesions possibly invading beyond the deep submucosa might pose undue risks. With the advanced appearance of this patient's lesion, tissue sampling only was pursued. Biopsy specimens were taken using cold forceps, although obtaining large pieces of tissue was challenging due to the mass's firm texture. Submucosal tattoos were placed near the lesion for easier localization if surgical removal was needed. Although the biopsy results were inconclusive, cancer remained the main concern, and the patient was referred to the colorectal surgery clinic.
