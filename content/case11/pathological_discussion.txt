## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Deshpande: The resected specimen included portions of the cecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum, as well as the appendix. On gross examination, the colonic wall was thickened and fibrosed, but no discrete mass was visible. On histologic examination, the colonic wall contained eosinophils, including several microabscesses. There was transmural fibrosis, and there were vascular channels with necrotizing inflammation (Fig. 3A and 3B). Medium-sized colonic arteries were infiltrated by histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. A single arterial channel showed an intraluminal fragment with an intensely eosinophilic appearance (Fig. 3C and 3D). On examination of a second section, an intravascular structure that resembled a parasite was present, with a cuticle-like external layer beneath which internal organs were identified, albeit degenerated (Fig. 3D).

Figure 3. Colectomy Specimens. On hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel A), the submucosa of the colon shows two foci of vasculitis (arrows). On elastin staining (Panel B), the arterial channel is surrounded by elastic fibers, and focal fragmentation of the elastic fibers is present (arrow). On hematoxylin and eosin staining at higher magnification (Panel C), a single arterial channel shows an intraluminal fragment with an intensely eosinophilic appearance (arrow), with a surrounding infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils. On a second section (Panel D), an intravascular structure that resembles a nematode is present in the center of the vessel (arrowhead), with transmural inflammation of the surrounding vessel (arrow). On trichrome staining (Panel D, inset), the nematode is highlighted, showing a cuticle-like external layer (arrow) and internal organs (asterisk).

The presence of intravascular material with a cuticle-like surface and an internal structure supported the diagnosis of infection with an intravascular nematode. The absence of a well-preserved adult nematode and of eggs, embryos, and larvae hampered definitive identification of the species, but *A. costaricensis* was a top consideration in this patient from Guatemala who had involvement of the mesenteric vasculature.16 The eggs, embryos, and larvae of *A. costaricensis* induce an inflammatory reaction, and the intravascular nematodes initiate thrombosis of arterial channels. Long-standing disease can induce fibrosis and mass-forming cecal lesions, such as the lesion seen in this patient.

This patient had the characteristic histologic findings associated with *A. costaricensis* infection, including massive transmural eosinophilic infiltration and eosinophilic vasculitis with an intravascular nematode. In a case in which the parasite is not identified, the differential diagnosis includes vasculitis involving the gastrointestinal tract, which can have a similar overall histologic appearance to *A. costaricensis* infection, and thus it can be difficult to distinguish between the two entities. However, the presence of an adult nematode rules out gastrointestinal vasculitis in this patient.17,18
