## Presentation of Case

Dr. Josephine Henderson-Frost (Medicine): A 66-year-old woman presented to a community health center affiliated with this hospital for an initial evaluation and to establish care with a primary care provider.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before presentation, when fevers and throbbing pain in the left ear and on the left side of the face developed. The pain radiated to the jaw and was associated with neck stiffness and tinnitus. She was evaluated by a physician in Guatemala, where she was living when the symptoms began. Computed tomography (CT) of the head reportedly revealed findings consistent with sinusitis and otitis media of the left ear. The fevers and neck stiffness resolved without specific treatment, but the ear and facial pain persisted and did not diminish with the use of acetaminophen.

On presentation to the community health center, the patient reported an intentional weight loss of 7 kg during the 6 months before presentation, which she attributed to changes in her diet. She had no fever, night sweats, rash, chest pain, or shortness of breath. She had a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Dull, waxing and waning pain in the left side of the abdomen, which had begun after the birth of her youngest child, had not changed in location, quality, or intensity during the past 30 years.

Two years before presentation to the community health center, episodes of epigastric pain had developed. The pain was burning in quality, radiated toward the chest, occurred most frequently after meals, and was associated with diarrhea. At that time, the patient was evaluated by a physician in Guatemala, and testing reportedly revealed *Helicobacter pylori* infection. She was not treated with antibiotic agents, but the epigastric pain diminished with the administration of intermittent proton-pump inhibitor therapy.

Ten months before presentation to the community health center, the patient had been visiting New England and had presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation of epigastric pain. The epigastric pain was similar to previous episodes but did not diminish after 3 days of proton-pump inhibitor therapy. She reported no dark stools, fevers, chills, or sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 134/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 71.7 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The patient appeared to be well. The abdomen was tender on palpation of the epigastric area, without rebound or guarding. The bowel sounds were normal, and there was no palpable abdominal mass or hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Urinalysis, results of kidney function tests, and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and lipase were normal; other laboratory tests results are shown in Table 1. Stool culture revealed normal enteric flora. Examination of the stool for *H. pylori* antigen was negative. The patient was referred to a primary care clinic in New England for further evaluation, but the abdominal pain resolved and she returned to Guatemala.

On evaluation at the community health center, medications included alprazolam, aspirin, amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide, bisoprolol, and ciprofibrate. The patient was not taking any other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or herbal supplements. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She lived in a small, rural town in Guatemala. She often ate boiled fish, shrimp, and crayfish from the freshwater rivers around her home. She worked as a midwife and made frequent trips to New England to visit family. There was no family history of cancer or heart disease; several family members had been exposed to tuberculosis.

On examination, the weight was 65.8 kg and the BMI 29. There was tenderness on palpation of the left temporomandibular joint, temporal region, and cheek. The left jaw clicked with opening. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. There was a systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur, grade 2/6, that was best heard at the right upper sternal border. The bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft, without distention, mass, tenderness, rebound, or guarding. The remainder of the examination was normal. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.6% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4), and a lipid panel was normal. Tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, hepatitis B virus core antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Acetaminophen and jaw exercises with massage were recommended for the facial pain. The patient was referred for mammography and colonoscopy for age-appropriate cancer screening. Two days later, an interferon-γ release assay for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* was positive, and a chest radiograph was obtained.

Dr. Kristine S. Burk: The chest radiograph showed normal mediastinal contours without evidence of lymphadenopathy or cardiomegaly, clear pleural spaces without evidence of an effusion, and clear lungs without evidence of opacities, apical scarring, or calcified granulomas.

Dr. Henderson-Frost: One month after the initial visit, the patient returned to the community health center to discuss treatment options for latent tuberculosis infection. At that time, she reported a 2-month history of intermittent pain in the right upper and lower quadrants that had not been discussed at the previous visit. The physical examination was unchanged. CT of the abdomen was performed.

Dr. Burk: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material (Fig. 1), revealed an irregular, circumferential mass in the ascending colon that measured 4.5 cm in the craniocaudal dimension and had transmural extension. There was stranding in the adjacent pericolonic fat, and there were multiple adjacent enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. The appendix had mild wall thickening but was not dilated, and it contained air and stool; these features were consistent with inflammation related to the adjacent process in the ascending colon.

There is stranding in the adjacent pericolonic fat, and there are adjacent enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (blue arrow). The appendix (yellow arrow) has mild wall thickening, a feature consistent with inflammation related to the adjacent process in the ascending colon.
