## Schistosoma

Schistosomiasis affects more than 200 million people worldwide, with various species prevalent in different regions. *Schistosoma mansoni* is found in the Caribbean and South America. Adults mate and deposit eggs in the colonic submucosa, potentially leading to a colonic mass. This helminth typically migrates to the inferior mesenteric vein, resulting in inflammatory changes more frequently in the distal colon than in the ascending colon.
