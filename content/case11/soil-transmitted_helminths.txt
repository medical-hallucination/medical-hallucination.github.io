## Soil-Transmitted Helminths

Soil-transmitted helminths include Ascaris lumbricoides, *Trichuris trichiura*, and hookworm. The socalled neglected diseases caused by these pathogens are prevalent worldwide, including in Guatemala and the United States. Eosinophilia most commonly occurs early during infection, when larvae migrate through tissues before settling in the gastrointestinal tract.10 A moderate or high organism load in the gastrointestinal tract must usually be present for symptoms to occur. Gastrointestinal manifestations are varied and include dysentery-like syndromes, inflammatory bowel diseaseâ€“like syndromes, and inflammatory mass lesions, similar to that seen in this patient.
