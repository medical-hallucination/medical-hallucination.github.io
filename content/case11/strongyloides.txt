## Strongyloides

Strongyloidiasis affects 100 million people worldwide and is caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, which is endemic in Guatemala. S. stercoralis has a unique autoinfective life cycle that allows it to reproduce recurrently within the host, persisting for decades. Intestinal strongyloidiasis can cause intestinal mucosal congestion and ulceration, and peripheral eosinophilia is common.9
