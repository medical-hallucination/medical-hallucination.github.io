## Surgical Management

Dr. Hiroko Kunitake: This patient was seen in the colorectal surgery clinic, and I thought the possibility of colon cancer was very high despite the nondiagnostic biopsy. Colorectal cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, and the incidence increases with age. Chest CT was performed to complete a staging workup for suspected colon cancer, and it revealed no evidence of metastatic disease. During the patient's visit, we discussed oncologic resection, including ligation of the proximal mesenteric vessel and radical clearance of the lymphatic drainage basin of the potential tumor site. The location of this patient's lesion in the ascending colon meant that a colectomy of the right side of the colon would be necessary, which was an important consideration in weighing the risks and benefits of surgical resection. Right colectomy is generally technically less challenging than colectomy in other parts of the colon, because the mobility of the distal small bowel allows it to easily reach the transverse colon for an ileocolic anastomosis. Right colectomy is also associated with a shorter operative time and a lower intraoperative complication rate than other types of colectomy.14,15 This patient had had no previous abdominal surgeries, which made laparoscopic surgery more feasible.

The patient was taken to the operating room, and the laparoscope was introduced. There was no visible evidence of metastatic disease. The cecum and ascending colon were matted and thickened. A laparoscopic right colectomy was performed. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged home on postoperative day 2.
