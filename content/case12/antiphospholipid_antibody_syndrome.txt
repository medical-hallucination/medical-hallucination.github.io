## Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome

The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by thromboses, thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis, and embolism. Ischemic stroke may result from in situ thrombosis or embolism due to valvular heart disease. This patient possibly had an infection, and patients with infection commonly have transient positivity for antiphospholipid antibody. The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an unlikely diagnosis in this case, because it is usually associated with microthrombosis and not macrothrombosis and because the patient had a negative test for lupus anticoagulant. However, the negative test for lupus anticoagulant does not rule out the diagnosis, because only half the patients with thrombotic storm are reported to have positivity for antiphospholipid antibody, presumably owing to consumption of the antibody.
