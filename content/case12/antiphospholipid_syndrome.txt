## Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is characterized by thromboses, thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis, and embolism. Ischemic stroke may result from in situ thrombosis or embolism due to valvular heart disease. This particular patient may have had an infection, and patients with infections often have transient positivity for antiphospholipid antibody. However, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because it is typically associated with microthrombosis, not macrothrombosis, and the patient had a negative test for lupus anticoagulant. The negative test does not entirely rule out the diagnosis, as only half of the patients with thrombotic storm show antibody positivity, likely due to antibody consumption.
