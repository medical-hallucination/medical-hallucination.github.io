## Atrial Myxoma

Could an intracardiac tumor have caused systemic embolization in this patient? Atrial myxomas are the most common primary tumors of the heart, and affected patients can present with constitutional symptoms such as fever and widespread embolization. However, the findings on echocardiography in this patient would not be typical of a myxoma, which is most commonly manifested by a mass that is attached to the interatrial septum.
