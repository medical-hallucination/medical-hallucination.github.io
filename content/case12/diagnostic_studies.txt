## Diagnostic Studies

Dr. Sanborn: TEE was performed to more completely assess the mitral-valve abnormality and to rule out other cardiac sources of an embolus. Diffuse echogenic material was visualized along the left atrial surface of the anterior and posterior mitral-valve leaflets, along the valvular coaptation line (Fig. 3B and 3C). The material had broad-based attachment to the mitral valve, with only minimal mobility (see Videos 1 through 4, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The severity of mitral regurgitation was mild to moderate (Fig. 3D), and the regurgitant jet originated at the central coaptation point of the leaflets. No perivalvular invasion or abscess was noted. No other valvular abnormalities or other cardiogenic sources of an embolus were identified.

On the basis of the appearance, mobility pattern, and location of the echogenic material, the differential diagnosis included bacterial endocarditis, thrombosis, or both. The absence of a positive blood culture and of apparent marked destruction of the underlying valvular tissue makes a bacterial cause of the vegetation unlikely.
