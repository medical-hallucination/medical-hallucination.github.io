## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Tomas G. Neilan: This previously healthy 57-year-old man had an illness that developed over several weeks, characterized by fever, pulmonary opacities, cardiac and valvular dysfunction, and emboli to multiple vascular beds. In developing a differential diagnosis, I considered conditions associated with widespread thrombosis or embolism to multiple vascular territories, such as paradoxical emboli, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, mural thrombi associated with cardiomyopathy, atrial myxoma, acute rheumatic fever, culture-negative infective endocarditis, and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.
