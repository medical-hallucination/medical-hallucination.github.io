## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Tomas G. Neilan: This previously healthy 57-year-old man had an illness that developed over the course of several weeks and was characterized by fever, pulmonary opacities, cardiac and valvular dysfunction, and emboli to multiple vascular beds. In developing a differential diagnosis, I will consider conditions that are associated with widespread thrombosis or embolism to multiple vascular territories, such as paradoxical emboli, the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, mural thrombi associated with cardiomyopathy, atrial myxoma, acute rheumatic fever, culture-negative infective endocarditis, and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis.
