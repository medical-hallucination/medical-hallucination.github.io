## Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a prothrombotic disorder caused by antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. When the syndrome is not recognized, it can lead to macrovascular clotting and is often considered in recent hospital patients with thrombosis. However, this patient had a relatively normal platelet count at the time of presentation, despite evidence of systemic embolization. Notably, he had no known previous exposure to heparin.
