## Infectious Causes of Systemic Embolization

Acute rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that develops as a complication of a streptococcal infection. Clinical manifestations include carditis, valvulitis, and central nervous system involvement. Carditis occurs in approximately 40 to 50% of patients with acute rheumatic fever, and pericarditis occurs in 5 to 10%. However, this patient was older than 25 years of age and was living in the United States, where the incidence of rheumatic fever is low. In addition, he did not present with signs or symptoms consistent with streptococcal infection, such as pharyngitis or rash, and he was treated with antibacterial therapy that would be expected to have activity against most streptococci.

Culture-negative infective endocarditis accounts for 2 to 30% of all cases of endocarditis. Some aspects of this patient's history suggest that it is a possible diagnosis. The patient had been treated with several antibiotic agents. He had had contact with farm animals (associated with infection with *Brucella* species or *Coxiella*), soil and straw (*Coxiella*), cats (*Bartonella henselae*), and birds (*Chlamydia psittaci*). He also had chronic alcohol use (*Bartonella quintana*) and potential liver dysfunction with resultant immunosuppression (Cryptococcus). However, testing for antibodies to *Brucella* and *Coxiella* was negative. In addition, culture-negative infective endocarditis is an unlikely diagnosis given the discordance between the subtle valvular appearance and lesion and the widespread extent of embolization. Nevertheless, these infectious entities are important to consider, since the diagnosis of culture-negative infective endocarditis is notoriously difficult to establish.
