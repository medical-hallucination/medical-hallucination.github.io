## Mural Thrombi Associated With Cardiomyopathy

Mural thrombi that are associated with cardiomyopathy result from stasis in the left ventricular blood flow, and they can cause widespread systemic embolization. The incidence of mural thrombi is probably underestimated; they occur in 5 to 8% of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mural thrombi are unlikely in this case, because the risk of embolism with mural thrombi is approximately 10 to 15%, even in the absence of anticoagulation, and because patients with mural thrombi typically have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%, as compared with a measurement of 35% in this patient. Furthermore, there was no evidence of a dyskinetic segment on TTE, and the ventricular dysfunction was probably of recent onset. However, it should be noted that the windows for performing echocardiography in this patient were limited, an opacification agent for the detection of a left ventricular thrombus was not administered during echocardiography, and echocardiography is less sensitive than cardiac MRI for the detection of a thrombus (23% vs. 88%).
