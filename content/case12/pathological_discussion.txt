## Pathological Discussion

At autopsy, tannish-white nodules were found on the pleural surface of the left lung. Examination of lung tissue sections revealed a firm, fleshy nodular mass centered in the parenchyma, indicative of primary pulmonary carcinoma. Enlarged hilar lymph nodes were also identified. Microscopic examination showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with pleomorphic giant cells; metastatic disease was present in multiple hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical staining revealed positivity for keratin 7, thyroid transcription factor 1, and napsin A, supporting the diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin.

The heart had multiple tannish-yellow granular, friable vegetations on the atrial surface of the mitral valve. Microscopic evaluation showed the vegetations were composed of acellular fibrin, without inflammation, and were well demarcated from the mitral valve. This appearance is compatible with nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, corroborated by negative cultures and special stains for organisms. Thrombi were found in the lungs, heart, spleen, kidneys, and brain, causing infarction. Fibrin thrombi were present in glomerular capillary loops in the kidneys, consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

If the patient had not experienced rapid deterioration, the management of his non–small-cell lung cancer, specifically stage IV adenocarcinoma of the left lower lobe, would generally have been determined by tumor stage, histology, and performance status. For favorable performance status in stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer, treatment may include cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, guided by the tumor's molecular profile. However, due to the patient's poor performance status and critical illness, the approach would have focused on best supportive care.
