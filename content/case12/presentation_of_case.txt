## Presentation Of Case

Dr. Joshua A. Cohen (Medicine): A 57-year-old man presented to this hospital with confusion, cough, fever, and unintentional weight loss.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when malaise and anorexia developed. Four weeks later, a nonproductive cough developed, along with fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.6°C, and the patient sought medical attention at another hospital. A chest radiograph showed an opacity in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1A). In addition, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous cefdinir and azithromycin were administered initially. The next day, treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin. After the patient had received levofloxacin for 6 days, he was discharged home.

One day after discharge, fever and cough persisted and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. A sputum culture was obtained. Treatment with levofloxacin was stopped, and intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin were administered. After 2 days of parenteral therapy, the patient had some symptom relief; piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin were discontinued, and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was administered. The patient was discharged home with a plan to complete a 10-day course of antibacterial therapy.

Fatigue, cough, and malaise continued. Night sweats and fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.8°C occurred daily, anorexia worsened, and weakness developed, such that the patient could not walk without assistance. Ten days after the second discharge (2 days before this presentation), the patient's wife noted that the patient was incoherent, disoriented, angry, and belligerent, and she found him urinating inappropriately around their home. On the evening of presentation, she found him showering while clothed. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the other hospital.

Figure 1. Initial Chest Radiograph and Electrocardiogram. A chest radiograph obtained at the other hospital (Panel A) shows an opacity in the left lower lobe. An electrocardiogram obtained on admission to this hospital (Panel B) shows sinus rhythm at 99 beats per minute, with 1‑mm concave ST‑segment elevations and PR‑seg‑ ment depressions in leads 2, 3, and aVF; subtle PR‑segment elevation in lead aVR; and submillimeter upsloping ST‑segment depressions in lateral and anterior leads. The findings could indicate pericarditic or ischemic changes.

On the patient's presentation to that hospital, the temperature was 38.3°C, the heart rate 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. He was confused and unable to answer questions appropriately. Laboratory test results were notable for a troponin I level of 13.4 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.04), a lactate level of 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter [reference range, 0.4 to 2.0 mmol per liter; 6 to 18 mg per deciliter]), and a white-cell count of 21,800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 10,500). Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiography reportedly revealed sinus tachycardia, premature atrial beats, and submillimeter inferior ST-segment elevations. Because the patient had tachypnea and increased somnolence, the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation initiated. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin–tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, lorazepam, and propofol were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the emergency department of this hospital for consideration of coronary angiography.

On the patient’s arrival at this hospital, a limited history was obtained from his wife. There was no report of chest pain, dyspnea, edema, or symptoms of arrhythmia. He had a history of eczema. He took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications, but he had a history of anaphylaxis to bee stings. The patient smoked cigarettes and had smoked 1 pack daily for the past 41 years; he also drank 8 to 10 beers per night, occasionally along with 2 to 3 glasses of wine, and smoked marijuana daily. He was a farmer, and he restored farmhouses and cleaned horse stables. He owned sheep and goats and had previously owned exotic birds. There was a family history of cancer; his sister had died of breast cancer at 42 years of age, and his father had died of an unknown cancer when he was in his 40s.

The temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/82 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 500 ml, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.80. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. When the level of sedation was reduced, the patient opened his eyes and grimaced spontaneously but did not follow commands. He did not blink in response to threat or withdraw from noxious stimuli. The corneal reflexes were intact. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. There was no rash. The rest of the examination was normal.

Blood levels of phosphorus, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, globulin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin and the activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A serum test was negative for acetaminophen, ethanol, tricyclic antidepressants, and salicylates, but urine toxicology screening was positive for cannabinoids. Cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Nucleic-acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus.

Dr. Cohen: While the patient was in the emergency department, a 23-second episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred. Aspirin was administered rectally, and magnesium and cefepime intravenously; infusions of propofol, normal saline, and amiodarone were also administered. Cardiac catheterization was considered but deferred. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Additional imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed persistent patchy opacity in the left lower lobe (Fig. 2A), without evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. CT of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed subtle hypoattenuation and loss of differentiation between gray and white matter in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, findings that raised concerns about an acute-to-subacute infarct; there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the intravenous and oral administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe (Fig. 2B), which had progressed since CT was last performed, 4 weeks earlier at the other hospital. Changes consistent with segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli were present in the right lower lobe, without evidence of strain on the right side of the heart. A wedge-shaped subpleural consolidation in the right lower lobe (Fig. 2C) was consistent with a pulmonary infarct. There were new bilateral small pleural effusions. Multiple splenic and renal wedge-shaped hypoattenuating lesions were consistent with infarcts (Fig. 2D).

Dr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed numerous bilateral acute-to-subacute cerebral infarcts (Fig. 2E) and punctate infarcts scattered throughout the cerebellar hemispheres. A few scattered punctate foci of susceptibility artifact raised concerns about microhemorrhages. Time-of-flight imaging revealed a linear susceptibility signal in the distal branches of the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery and loss of flow-related enhancement in the left superior middle cerebral artery, findings suggestive of thrombosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed.

Dr. Danita Y. Sanborn: TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, with diffuse hypokinesis that was most prominent in the inferior territory. On studies obtained after the administration of agitated saline, there was no evidence of a patent foramen ovale. The mitral-valve leaflets were focally thickened, with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. A small circumferential pericardial effusion was present (Fig. 3A).

Dr. Cohen: Tests were negative for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies, β2-glycoprotein IgM and IgG antibodies, anti–cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, and anti–rheumatoid factor antibody; a test for antineutrophil antibody was positive at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern. Intravenous vancomycin and thiamine and enteral doxycycline, atorvastatin, omeprazole, and metoprolol were administered.

On the second day, the temperature was 38.4°C and repeat cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Tests were negative for anti-Ro (SSA), anti-La (SSB), and anti–Jo-1 antibodies, as well as IgM and IgG antibodies to brucella and coxiella (the agent causing Q fever) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Ultrasonography of the arms and legs was negative for a thrombus. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed blood-tinged secretions in multiple airway segments. Gram staining of the BAL fluid revealed no leukocytes or organisms. Fungal wet preparation and acid-fast stains of the BAL fluid were negative, as was staining for *Pneumocystis jiroveci* and nucleic-acid testing for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, direct fluorescence antibody testing of the BAL fluid was negative for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3.

A diagnostic test was performed.
