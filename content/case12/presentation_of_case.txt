Dr. Joshua A. Cohen (Medicine): A 57-year-old man presented to this hospital with confusion, cough, fever, and unintentional weight loss.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 7 weeks before this presentation, when malaise and anorexia developed. Four weeks later, a nonproductive cough developed, along with fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.6°C, and the patient sought medical attention at another hospital. A chest radiograph showed an opacity in the left lower lobe (Fig. 1A). In addition, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed consolidation in the left lower lobe. The patient was admitted to the other hospital, and intravenous cefdinir and azithromycin were administered initially. The next day, treatment was switched to oral levofloxacin. After the patient had received levofloxacin for 6 days, he was discharged home.

One day after discharge, fever and cough persisted, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. A sputum culture was obtained. Treatment with levofloxacin was stopped, and intravenous piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin were administered. After 2 days of parenteral therapy, the patient had some symptom relief; piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin were discontinued, and amoxicillin–clavulanic acid was administered. The patient was discharged home with a plan to complete a 10-day course of antibacterial therapy.

Fatigue, cough, and malaise continued. Night sweats and fevers to a maximum temperature of 37.8°C occurred daily, anorexia worsened, and weakness developed, such that the patient could not walk without assistance. Ten days after the second discharge (2 days before this presentation), the patient's wife noted that the patient was incoherent, disoriented, angry, and belligerent, and she found him urinating inappropriately around their home. On the evening of presentation, she found him showering while clothed. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the other hospital.

**Figure 1. Initial Chest Radiograph and Electrocardiogram.** A chest radiograph obtained at the other hospital (Panel A) shows an opacity in the left lower lobe. An electrocardiogram obtained on admission to this hospital (Panel B) shows sinus rhythm at 99 beats per minute, with 1‑mm concave ST‑segment elevations and PR-segment depressions in leads 2, 3, and aVF; subtle PR-segment elevation in lead aVR; and submillimeter upsloping ST-segment depressions in lateral and anterior leads. The findings could indicate pericarditic or ischemic changes.

On the patient's presentation to that hospital, the temperature was 38.3°C, the heart rate 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/73 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. He was confused and unable to answer questions appropriately. Laboratory test results were notable for a troponin I level of 13.4 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.04), a lactate level of 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter), and a white-cell count of 21,800 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 4500 to 10,500). Blood cultures were obtained. Electrocardiography reportedly revealed sinus tachycardia, premature atrial beats, and submillimeter inferior ST-segment elevations. Because the patient had tachypnea and increased somnolence, the trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation started. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin–tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, lorazepam, and propofol were administered, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to this hospital.

On the patient’s arrival at this hospital, a limited history was obtained from his wife. There was no report of chest pain, dyspnea, edema, or symptoms of arrhythmia. He had a history of eczema. He took no medications and had no known adverse reactions to medications, but he had a history of anaphylaxis to bee stings. The patient smoked cigarettes and had smoked 1 pack daily for the past 41 years; he also drank 8 to 10 beers per night, occasionally along with 2 to 3 glasses of wine, and smoked marijuana daily. He was a farmer, and he restored farmhouses and cleaned horse stables. He owned sheep and goats and had previously owned exotic birds. There was a family history of cancer; his sister had died of breast cancer at 42 years of age, and his father had died of an unknown cancer when he was in his 40s.

The temperature was 37.2°C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/82 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving mechanical ventilation at a rate of 18 breaths per minute, with a tidal volume of 500 ml, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cm of water, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.80. The pupils were 2 mm in diameter and sluggishly reactive. When the level of sedation was reduced, the patient opened his eyes and grimaced spontaneously but did not follow commands. He did not blink in response to threat or withdraw from noxious stimuli. The corneal reflexes were intact. The toes were downgoing bilaterally. There was no rash. The rest of the examination was normal.

Blood levels of phosphorus, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, globulin, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, and thyrotropin and the activated partial-thromboplastin time were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A serum test was negative for acetaminophen, ethanol, tricyclic antidepressants, and salicylates, but urine toxicology screening was positive for cannabinoids. Cultures of the blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Nucleic-acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for influenza virus types A and B and respiratory syncytial virus.

Dr. Cohen: While the patient was in the emergency department, a 23-second episode of ventricular tachycardia occurred. Aspirin was administered rectally, and magnesium and cefepime intravenously; infusions of propofol, normal saline, and amiodarone were also given. Cardiac catheterization was considered but deferred. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Additional imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed persistent patchy opacity in the left lower lobe (Fig. 2A), without signs of pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. CT of the head revealed subtle hypoattenuation in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, which raised concerns about an acute-to-subacute infarct; there was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after administration of contrast material, showed progression of consolidation in the left lower lobe (Fig. 2B) consistent with segmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe. Changes consistent with a pulmonary infarct and multiple splenic and renal wedge-shaped hypoattenuating lesions were seen (Fig. 2C and 2D).
