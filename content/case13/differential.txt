Dr. Ronald J. Falk: This 71-year-old man presented with rapidly declining kidney function and hema- turia. His serum creatinine level rose over a period of 2 months, from 0.8 to 4.9 mg per deciliter. In constructing a differential diagnosis, the first step is to determine whether this patient’s de- clining kidney function is due to an obstructive
uropathy, a prerenal condition, or intrinsic kidney disease.

The patient had few symptoms involving the urinary tract and had no evidence of hydrone- phrosis on renal ultrasonography, making obstructive uropathy an unlikely diagnosis in this case. A prerenal insult such as intravascular volume depletion would be unlikely to cause the degree of acute kidney injury seen in this patient in the absence of considerable preexisting kid- ney disease. Furthermore, the administration of intravenous saline did not result in a marked im- provement in renal function, which also makes intravascular volume depletion an unlikely ex- planation for this patient’s presentation. Medi- cations that could alter the glomerular filtration rate, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and angiotensin-converting– enzyme inhibitors, had been discontinued. There- fore, the disease process is most likely intrinsic to the kidney.

** Examination of the Urinary Sediment ** 
Much can be gleaned from descriptions of the urinary sediment. On initial presentation, the urine was described as the color of cola, and examination of the urinary sediment revealed red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts, findings suggesting glomerulonephritis.1 The results of urinalysis and the deteriorating kidney function raised concerns, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was started.
The presence of white-cell casts raises the possibility of interstitial nephritis. Although in- terstitial nephritis may be caused by facultative gram-negative anaerobes (e.g., yersinia) that are acquired during foreign travel,2 interstitial nephri- tis rarely causes macroscopic hematuria. Given the degree of hematuria seen in this patient, intersti- tial nephritis would be unlikely and other com- mon causes of hematuria should be considered.
A subsequent examination of the urinary sediment revealed nondysmorphic red cells and no cellular casts, findings suggesting a source of bleeding in the urinary tract. Renal ultrasonog- raphy and CT without contrast enhancement revealed simple kidney cysts and one minimally complex cystic mass (Bosniak 2 classification) of little clinical significance, along with a con- tracted bladder. Although a source of bleeding in the urinary tract cannot be ruled out, it would be an unlikely cause of rapidly declining kidney function in this patient.

** Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis **
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient, and the workup would need to proceed quickly to prevent glomerular and interstitial scarring. Evalu- ation of the serum complement (C3 and C4) levels is very helpful in narrowing the differen- tial diagnosis. Activation of the classic comple- ment pathway, which reduces both the C4 level and the C3 level, suggests glomerular disease due to a process such as systemic lupus erythemato- sus or cryoglobulinemia. Activation of the alter- native complement pathway, which results in a low C3 level and a normal C4 level, raises the possibility of a variety of infectious diseases and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In this case, the C3 and C4 levels were normal, suggesting that the declining kidney function was due to a process such as IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)– positive glomerulonephritis, or anti–glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Goodpas- ture’s syndrome).
This patient had several negative serologic tests, including tests specific for hepatitis B and C viruses, findings that decrease the likelihood of viral glomerulonephritis. A negative anti– double-stranded DNA test makes the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus unlikely, and neg- ative tests for antiproteinase 3 and antimyeloper- oxidase antibodies, on two separate occasions, decrease the likelihood that ANCAs were driving the disease pathogenesis. There is no mention of serologic testing for anti-GBM antibodies.
With any diagnosis of glomerulonephritis, two separate yet intertwined questions should be asked. First, is the inflammatory condition limit- ed to the kidney, or is it part of a systemic dis- ease process? The presence of extrarenal mani- festations aids in narrowing the differential diagnosis. For example, a patient could have a pulmonary–renal syndrome (e.g., ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis or anti-GBM disease) or crampy abdominal pain associated with IgA vasculitis of the bowel. In this case, crampy ab- dominal pain is the only extrarenal clue. Second, do extrarenal manifestations provide clues to the pathogenesis of the disease? In this case, the
intersection of infection and kidney disease sharpens the focus.

** Infection and Kidney Disease **
Some infections (e.g., hepatitis B or C virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus infec- tion, syphilis, and staphylococcal infection) may cause kidney disease, and some may aggravate existing kidney conditions, such as IgA nephrop- athy or anti-GBM disease, or may drive the cause of kidney disease. This case contains many clues. Could the patient have received an infection from his wife or grandchildren or during his recent travel to Mexico? The list of possible transmis- sions is long. Since the patient was known to have diverticular disease, his intermittent lower abdominal cramping and discomfort were most likely due to colitis or diverticulitis. He began to receive antibiotic therapy, which was broadened to provide coverage of the gram-negative anaerobes that grew in the blood culture. There are over two dozen genera of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, and Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum lead the list of possibilities in this case. An endovascular infection of the aortic aneurysm or a cardiac valve is possible but unlikely, given the absence of vegetations on echocardiography and the relatively normal periaortic region on CT.

** Gram-NegativeBacteremia and Glomerulonephritis **
Could the gram-negative bacteremia have contributed to the immunopathogenesis of this pa- tient’s glomerulonephritis? IgA nephropathy is caused by defects of mucosal immunity, and the interplay between this glomerular disease and intestinal disorders is well documented.3 Flares ofIgAnephropathymayoccursynchronouslywith gastrointestinal infections. Patients with IgA vas- culitis (Henoch–Schönlein purpura) may present with crampy abdominal pain. That said, rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy would be a highly unusual new diagnosis in a 71-year-old patient with no previous episodes of macroscopic hema- turia. It is possible that he had an ANCA-negative necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis that mimicked ANCA-positive glomerulonephri- tis.4 Both IgA nephropathy and ANCA-negative glomerulonephritis must remain in the differen- tial diagnosis.
The most likely diagnosis in this patient is anti-GBM disease — a cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in both the young and the old. Anti-GBM disease may cause pulmonary bleed- ing, but this patient had no evidence of such bleeding. Anti-GBM disease does not affect ab- dominal organs. Do the crampy abdominal pain and gram-negative anaerobic bacteremia provide insight into the disease process in this patient?
Autoimmune diseases occur as a consequence of multiple factors and not a single “hit.” The patient must lose immunologic tolerance to the autoantigen; specifically, patients with anti-GBM disease lose immunologic tolerance to a remark- ably restricted epitope on the noncollagenous domain of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, known as alpha-3(IV)NC1 or Goodpasture’s anti- gen.5,6 This antigen is normally hidden from immune surveillance and must undergo a struc- tural change or “autoantigen conformopathy” to permit its interaction with circulating anti-GBM antibodies.7
Genetic predisposition and environmental factors play a role in autoantibody formation and autoantigen availability. Anti-GBM disease is marked by “spatial and temporal clustering,”8 in- dicating the importance of genetic and environ- mental factors. Genetic predisposition is based on a very strong HLA association.9 Environmen- tal risks are numerous and include cigarette smoking and infection. Ernest Goodpasture’s original case (which may actually have been a case of ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis) was associated with the influenza outbreak of 1918.10 The occurrence of seasonal variations of disease in spring and early summer suggests infectious triggers. In a recent study,11 67% of patients with anti-GBM disease had prodromal fever and bac- terial infections due to a variety of gram-nega- tive bacteria.
The immunopathogenic potential of microbes in anti-GBM disease has been tested in several ways. An important human B-cell epitope of alpha-3(IV)NC1 overlaps with a T-cell epitope of murine anti-GBM disease, suggesting that a critical amino acid motif is responsible for auto- immunity in anti-GBM disease. When this amino acid motif was screened against microbial pro- tein databases, seven microbe-derived peptides based on this motif were found. Circulating anti- bodies to these bacteria were discovered in the circulation of patients with anti-GBM disease.12

Three of these microbial peptides were from bacteroides species.
This patient’s anti-GBM disease may be an example of molecular mimicry induced by a gram-negative anaerobe such as bacteroides or other gram-negative bacteria that contribute to diver- ticulitis. There are two other mechanisms by which infection may have exacerbated the dis- ease. First, anti-GBM antibodies can be found in the circulation for months or years before the manifestation of disease,13 and it is possible that a bacteroides infection revved up the produc- tion of anti-GBM antibodies. Second, the criti- cal alpha-3(IV)NC1 epitope must undergo auto- antigen conformopathy,14 and it is possible that an infectious milieu exposed the hidden antigen.
There is another diagnostic consideration in this case. This patient had much more marked proteinuria than would be expected in a patient with anti-GBM disease. A protein:creatinine ratio of 5.71 would most likely result from perturba- tion of podocytes induced by another glomerular disease. For example, the patient could have had concurrentmembranousnephropathyassociated with cancer caused by years of cigarette smoking. However, this man, who had obesity and glucose intolerance and was receiving metformin, most likely had mild concurrent diabetic nephropathy. In North America, there is an epidemic of diabe- tes and diabetic nephropathy that can coexist with any glomerular disease.15 To establish the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease in this patient, I would perform a kidney biopsy.
Dr. David M. Dudzinski (Cardiology): Dr. Fenves, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this patient?
Dr. Andrew Z. Fenves: This 71-year-old patient had a rapid decline in renal function and active urinary sediment with red cells and red-cell casts. He had some response to intravenous methyl- prednisolone. All these findings point to a rapid- lyprogressive(crescentic)glomerulonephritis.Our differential diagnosis included ANCA-positive pauci-immuneglomerulonephritis,anti-GBMdis- ease, IgA nephropathy (supported by his episodes of gross hematuria), and the least likely possibil- ity of systemic lupus erythematosus–associated nephritis. The presence of proteinuria in the nephrotic range raised the possibility of NSAID- induced membranous glomerulonephritis or dia- betic nephropathy.
