## Examination Of The Urinary Sediment

Much can be gleaned from descriptions of the urinary sediment. On initial presentation, the urine was described as the color of cola, and examination of the urinary sediment revealed red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts, findings suggesting glomerulonephritis. The results of urinalysis and the deteriorating kidney function raised concerns, and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was started.

The presence of white-cell casts raises the possibility of interstitial nephritis. Although interstitial nephritis may be caused by facultative gram-negative anaerobes (e.g., yersinia) that are acquired during foreign travel, interstitial nephritis rarely causes macroscopic hematuria. Given the degree of hematuria seen in this patient, interstitial nephritis would be unlikely and other common causes of hematuria should be considered.

A subsequent examination of the urinary sediment revealed nondysmorphic red cells and no cellular casts, findings suggesting a source of bleeding in the urinary tract. Renal ultrasonography and CT without contrast enhancement revealed simple kidney cysts and one minimally complex cystic mass (Bosniak 2 classification) of little clinical significance, along with a contracted bladder. Although a source of bleeding in the urinary tract cannot be ruled out, it would be an unlikely cause of rapidly declining kidney function in this patient.
