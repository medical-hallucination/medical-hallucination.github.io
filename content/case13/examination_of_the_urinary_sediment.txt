## Examination of the Urinary Sediment

Much can be gleaned from descriptions of the urinary sediment. On initial presentation, the urine was described as the color of cola, and examination of the urinary sediment revealed red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts, findings suggesting glomerulonephritis. The results of urinalysis and deteriorating kidney function raised concerns, leading to treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone.

The presence of white-cell casts raises the possibility of interstitial nephritis, although it is unlikely given the degree of hematuria. Interstitial nephritis rarely causes macroscopic hematuria, which suggests other common causes should be considered.

A subsequent examination of the urinary sediment revealed nondysmorphic red cells and no cellular casts, indicating a possible source of bleeding in the urinary tract. Renal ultrasonography and CT without contrast revealed simple kidney cysts and one minimally complex cystic mass (Bosniak 2 classification) of little clinical significance, along with a contracted bladder. While a source of bleeding in the urinary tract cannot be ruled out completely, it would be an unlikely cause of this patient's rapidly declining kidney function.
