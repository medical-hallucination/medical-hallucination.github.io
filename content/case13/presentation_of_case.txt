## Presentation of Case

**Dr. Joshua Z. Drago (Medicine):** 

A 71-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of worsening renal function and hematuria. 

Three weeks before this admission, the patient’s wife became ill with chills, fatigue, and myalgias, and she thought she had influenza. 

A few days later, the patient reportedly had a subjective fever, with intermittent shaking chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and mild diffuse myalgias. He noted that he had reduced his fluid intake and that his urine had become darker. His symptoms were temporarily relieved with the administration of acetaminophen.

Approximately 10 days before this admission, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, who thought the patient was dehydrated. Laboratory tests were performed, and the results came back later that day, revealing a serum creatinine level of 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 μmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.4 mg per deciliter [53 to 124 μmol per liter]); the creatinine level had been 0.8 mg per deciliter (71 μmol per liter) 2 months earlier. He was referred to the emergency department of another hospital. 

On evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported persistent constitutional symptoms, intermittent lower abdominal cramping, and increased darkening of the urine, which had become the color of cola. 

The temperature was 36.9°C, the heart rate 87 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/82 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 103.2 kg, and the mucous membranes were moist. The remainder of the examination was normal. 

Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses was negative, and a urine culture was obtained; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained. 

A chest radiograph was reportedly normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed bilateral renal cysts without evidence of hydronephrosis, diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis, cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis, and vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta, with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (3.9 cm in diameter). 

Intravenous normal saline was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. His outpatient medications were aspirin, atorvastatin, amlodipine with benazepril, metformin, cholecalciferol, and n–3 fatty acids, as well as ibuprofen every other day for knee pain. Ibuprofen, aspirin, benazepril, and metformin were discontinued on admission. 

Renal ultrasonography revealed normal-sized kidneys (13.3 cm on the right and 11.8 cm on the left), with bilateral cysts (≤5.5 cm in diameter), including one with a thin septation, and no evidence of hydronephrosis. A nephrology consultation was obtained; additional test results are shown in Table 1. 

On hospital day 4, the creatinine level decreased to 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 μmol per liter), but over the next 2 days, hematuria occurred and the creatinine level increased to 3.9 mg per deciliter (345 μmol per liter). Examination of the urinary sediment revealed red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts. 

Empirical treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was started, and a plan was made for kidney biopsy. Because the patient had temperatures of up to 37.7°C and persistent leukocytosis, two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Two days later, gram-negative rods grew in the two anaerobic bottles. 

Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was started, and methylprednisolone was discontinued. Repeat cultures of the blood and urine were obtained, ceftriaxone was discontinued, and treatment with cefepime and aztreonam was started. 

Repeat CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed an increased amount of perinephric fluid without evidence of a discrete abscess. It also revealed a hyperintense renal cyst (0.9 cm in diameter) in the right upper pole, new evidence of presacral fat stranding, and trace bilateral pleural effusions. 

An echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function and no valvular calcifications. On hospital day 11, the creatinine level was 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter), and the patient requested transfer to this hospital. 

On evaluation at this hospital, a review of systems was notable for gross hematuria with brown urine, fatigue, low-grade fevers, anorexia, and intermittent cough. 

The patient reported diffuse crampy abdominal pain that he rated at 3 on a scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the most severe pain). He reported that he had no dysuria, increase in urinary frequency, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, pharyngitis, dyspnea, rash, headache, or neurologic symptoms. 

The patient had a history of impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, eczema, benign colonic polyps, diverticulosis, and osteoarthritis of the knees, shoulders, and lumbar spine. He had undergone right inguinal hernia repair, as well as radical prostatectomy for the treatment of prostate cancer 16 years previously. He had had no adverse reactions to medications. 

Several of his five young grandchildren had been ill during the month before this admission. He had retired 1 year earlier from a job in sales, which had involved travel to Europe and most recently to Mexico. He had drunk 3 or 4 beers daily since he had retired. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years but had most recently smoked a few cigarettes per day. 

His father had had lung cancer and his mother had had diabetes, but there was no family history of autoimmune or renal disease. 

On physical examination, the temperature was 37.4°C, the heart rate 84 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 103.6 kg, the height 175 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 33.8. 

The patient appeared comfortable. Dentition was poor, but there were no oropharyngeal lesions. Auscultation of the chest revealed an early-peaking systolic murmur (grade 2/6) at the left base and bibasilar crackles. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there was no tenderness at the costovertebral angle. A left inguinal hernia was present. There were no septic lesions on the nails and no rashes. Voided urine was rose-colored, without clots. The rest of the examination was normal. 

Cultures of the urine and blood were obtained. Blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 

Examination of the urinary sediment revealed nondysmorphic red cells that were “too numerous to count,” a few granular casts, and no cellular casts. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and a urine test for Bence Jones protein was negative. 

**Dr. Jad S. Husseini:** 

CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material (Fig. 1). There was mild bilateral perinephric stranding with no hydronephrosis. The kidneys contained multiple, bilateral simple renal cortical cysts. There was colonic diverticulosis, predominantly involving the sigmoid colon, with fat stranding and multiple prominent lymph nodes in the sigmoid mesentery. These findings were compatible with acute sigmoid diverticulitis. The peritoneum contained a trace amount of free fluid and no free air. There were vascular calcifications involving the abdominal aorta and its major branches, with an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (3.9 cm in diameter). The lung bases were clear. There were trace bilateral pleural effusions. 

**Dr. Drago:** 

Intravenous ceftazidime and metronidazole were administered. 

On hospital day 2, crampy abdominal and suprapubic pain occurred and the urine appeared darker red. Diagnostic tests were performed.
