## Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis in this patient, necessitating swift workup to prevent glomerular and interstitial scarring. Evaluation of the serum complement (C3 and C4) levels is crucial in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Activation of the classic complement pathway, which reduces both the C4 and C3 levels, suggests glomerular disease due to conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or cryoglobulinemia. Alternatively, a low C3 level and a normal C4 level indicate a variety of infectious diseases and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In this case, the C3 and C4 levels were normal, pointing towards conditions like IgA nephropathy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–positive glomerulonephritis, or anti–glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Goodpasture's syndrome).

The patient had negative serologic tests for hepatitis B and C viruses, which lower the likelihood of viral glomerulonephritis. A negative anti–double-stranded DNA test makes systemic lupus erythematosus less likely, and negative results for antiproteinase 3 and antimyeloperoxidase antibodies on two occasions reduce the possibility of ANCA-driven disease pathogenesis. Serologic testing for anti-GBM antibodies is not mentioned. 

With any diagnosis of glomerulonephritis, consider if the inflammatory condition is limited to the kidney or part of a systemic disease process. Extrarenal manifestations help narrow the differential diagnosis. For example, a patient could have a pulmonary–renal syndrome (e.g., ANCA-positive glomerulonephritis or anti-GBM disease) or crampy abdominal pain associated with IgA vasculitis of the bowel. In this case, crampy abdominal pain is the only extrarenal clue. Hence, the intersection of infection and kidney disease sharpens the focus.
