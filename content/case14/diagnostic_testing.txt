# Diagnostic Testing

Dr. Baggett: After admission, a supervised fast was performed. During the fast, the patient consumed only water and, every 2 hours, a glucose level was obtained by fingerstick testing and an assessment was performed for subjective symptoms of hypoglycemia or objective evidence of altered mental status. At 6 hours, the blood glucose level was 48 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter) but the patient had no symptoms of hypoglycemia or evidence of altered mental status, so the supervised fast was continued. At 8 hours, the blood glucose level was 29 mg per deciliter (1.6 mmol per liter) and the patient reported weakness and fatigue. Blood levels of glucose, C-peptide, insulin, and Î²-hydroxybutyrate were obtained (Table 1). Serum and urine screens for hypoglycemic drugs were negative. A test for insulin antibodies was negative. Orange juice and dextrose were administered; the repeat blood glucose level was 200 mg per deciliter (11.1 mmol per liter) and the patient reported resolution of the weakness and fatigue. Because the results of the fasting study were consistent with insulinoma, localization studies, including CT and MRI of the abdomen, were performed, but they did not reveal any evidence of insulinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed to further evaluate the pancreas.

Dr. David G. Forcione: Approximately 98% of insulinomas are located in the pancreas, and 90% are smaller than 2 cm in diameter. In this patient, the goal of endoscopic ultrasonography was to identify any pancreatic abnormality that could be consistent with insulinoma, and if an abnormality was identified, to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the depth of the lesion to facilitate surgical planning for resection. Endoscopic ultrasonography has a higher sensitivity and specificity than CT or MRI for detecting lesions that are confirmed to be insulinoma on surgical pathological examination. However, the morphologic features of insulinomas on ultrasonography can vary, making some difficult to identify. On ultrasonography, 78% of insulinomas are hypoechoic (darker than the background tissue) and 3% are hyperechoic (lighter than the background tissue); 19% are isoechoic (the same as the background tissue) and therefore very difficult to find. In this patient, endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic, homogeneous, well-defined, nearly spherical lesion (1.6 cm in maximal dimension) located superficially in the head of the pancreas (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Core biopsies were obtained by passing a needle though the duodenal wall into the lesion. The cytopathology service performed a rapid interpretation of the biopsy material during the procedure.
