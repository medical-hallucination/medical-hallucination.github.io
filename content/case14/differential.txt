# Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Deborah J. Wexler: This patient presented with Whipple's triad: neuroglycopenic symptoms, a confirmed low glucose level at the time of the symptoms, and rapid resolution of the symptoms after correction of hypoglycemia. The clear evidence of hypoglycemia with Whipple's triad lowers the likelihood of other possible causes of the patient's presenting symptoms, such as seizure disorder, other neurologic conditions, or a toxic ingestion. Therefore, I will base my differential diagnosis on the causes of hypoglycemia in adults.

#### Hypoglycemia

The first branch point in developing a differential diagnosis in a patient with hypoglycemia is to assess whether the patient appears to be ill. Evaluation of hypoglycemia in patients with an evident medical illness is generally straightforward, because the hypoglycemia is usually attributable to a condition such as sepsis, end-stage liver failure, chronic renal failure, or another identifiable disorder. For patients who appear to be otherwise well, such as this patient, determining the cause of hypoglycemia is more challenging.

If this patient had been asymptomatic at the time that hypoglycemia had been detected on laboratory testing, I would have suspected a measurement artifact and repeated laboratory testing to confirm the glucose level. However, his confusion and agitation were consistent with symptomatic hypoglycemia, making laboratory error unlikely.

This patient had had similar episodes of altered mental status in the context of poor oral intake, and the episodes had improved after eating. Hypoglycemia can be caused by starvation and may be a manifestation of anorexia nervosa. However, this patient had a normal BMI and had not recently lost weight, so starvation is an unlikely cause of his hypoglycemia. Could his hypoglycemia be a physiological response to prolonged fasting?

Lean people can have very low glucose levels while fasting. However, people do not normally have adrenergic or neuroglycopenic symptoms during a fast, despite low glucose levels, because the glucose supply is physiologically regulated to meet the body's glucose requirement. Insulin and proinsulin are appropriately suppressed, triggering gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Although this patient's hypoglycemia occurred in the context of poor oral intake, which most likely exacerbated it, the symptomatic nature of the hypoglycemia suggests that prolonged fasting is not the primary cause.

Alcohol use is a common cause of hypoglycemia or can contribute to it. Alcohol metabolism decreases gluconeogenesis and increases the risk of hypoglycemia in the context of poor oral intake, poor nutritional status, and other causes of hypoglycemia, such as the use of insulin or other glucose-lowering drugs. This patient's past episodes of presumed hypoglycemia appeared to have been exacerbated by his alcohol use, but alcohol is unlikely to be the primary cause of hypoglycemia because he was not intoxicated at the time of this presentation.

#### Hyperinsulinemia

Hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinemia is rare but should be considered in this patient, who had no other apparent causes of the low blood glucose level. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia can be caused by autoimmune diseases, the ingestion of medications that cause beta cells in the pancreas to secrete insulin (e.g., sulfonylureas), altered secretion of insulin and gut hormones after gastrointestinal surgery, and insulinomas.

Autoimmune causes of hypoglycemia include insulin-receptor antibodies as well as anti-insulin antibodies that lead to the unpredictable release of endogenous insulin. These causes of hypoglycemia are unlikely in this patient because he had no personal or family history of autoimmune disease.

Factitious hypoglycemia — which may be due to accidental, purposeful, or malicious administration of insulin or oral glucose-lowering medications — should be considered in a hypoglycemic patient. If this patient were taking any medications, it would be important to examine the medication bottles, pill boxes, and pill identification numbers to rule out an error in medication dispensation. This patient had no known access to medications for himself or his family members that would point toward purposeful or malicious administration of a glucose-lowering drug. In addition, he did not actively seek medical attention, whereas patients who have a psychiatric disorder such as Munchausen's syndrome often do. I think the likelihood of factitious hypoglycemia is low in this case, but because it can be surreptitious or accidental, I would screen for oral hypoglycemic drugs (sulfonylureas and glinides) and measure the C-peptide and insulin levels at the time of hypoglycemia. If this patient were receiving exogenous insulin, I would expect him to have an elevated insulin level and a suppressed C-peptide level; insulin levels higher than those found on diagnostic nomograms can be a clue. If this patient were ingesting oral glucose-lowering drugs, I would expect both the insulin level and the C-peptide level to be elevated; screening for oral hypoglycemic drugs would be the only means of detection.

Hypoglycemia is observed in patients after gastrointestinal surgery, and this patient had undergone multiple esophageal dilations and a surgical repair of the inferior vena cava. Mild or asymptomatic hypoglycemia is common after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, with severe hypoglycemia occurring in approximately 1% of patients at 5 years. Several mechanisms have been described, centering on altered secretion of insulin and incretin hormones coupled with increased sensitivity to insulin due to rapid weight loss or, in rare cases, to nesidioblastosis. Other gastrointestinal procedures, most notably Nissen fundoplication, have been described as causing hypoglycemia. Without knowing the details of this patient's dilation and repair procedures, it is hard to determine whether his injuries or procedures had contributed to his hypoglycemia. However, hypoglycemia that is related to gastrointestinal surgery tends to occur after eating. This patient's hypoglycemia was triggered by fasting, making hypoglycemia related to surgery an unlikely diagnosis in this case.

#### Insulinoma

Insulinoma, which is the classic cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, is a rare neuroendocrine tumor. The tumor autonomously secretes insulin, causing an impaired or absent response to falling glucose levels; as in most endocrine tumors, some degree of suppression may be maintained in insulinoma. Consequently, in patients with insulinoma, the insulin and C-peptide levels are inappropriately elevated when the blood glucose level is low. Most patients with insulinoma have fasting hypoglycemia, but 10% have postprandial hypoglycemia. Nearly 90% of insulinomas are single, benign tumors; 6% are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.

Insulinoma usually leads to intermittent episodes of neuroglycopenic symptoms, which were described in this patient. Chronic inappropriate release of insulin impairs gluconeogenesis, the body's usual defense against hypoglycemia. Impaired gluconeogenesis is exacerbated by fasting and alcohol intake. Patients often unconsciously treat the symptoms of hypoglycemia by eating, which results in weight gain in 18% of patients. Hypoglycemia normally leads to the release of counterregulatory hormones, including epinephrine, cortisol, and glucagon. The release of epinephrine is what causes the sympathoadrenal symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as palpitations and diaphoresis. However, the recurrence of hypoglycemia leads to a decrease in the release of counterregulatory hormones, causing a profound unawareness of hypoglycemia. In the absence of sympathoadrenal symptoms, patients have neuroglycopenic symptoms, including blurry vision, confusion, garbled speech, and abnormal movements. Neuroglycopenic symptoms are directly related to the lack of glucose delivery to the brain. If hypoglycemia is recurrent or persistent, it may cause brain damage. A patient's unawareness of hypoglycemia can lead to a delay in diagnosis or even to the misdiagnosis of a seizure disorder or malingering. The median time to an accurate diagnosis of insulinoma is 1.5 years.

This patient's presentation is most consistent with insulinoma, as indicated by the presence of Whipple's triad, the chronicity and characteristics of the episodes, and the exacerbation of symptoms by alcohol use and poor oral intake. The urine ketone level, obtained to measure urinary acetoacetate, most likely corresponded to a serum β-hydroxybutyrate level of approximately 0.5 mmol per liter. The ketone level was abnormally low because insulin was suppressing lipolysis, perhaps because of the action of epinephrine on hormone-sensitive lipase in the context of hypovolemia and gastrointestinal illness. An unawareness of hypoglycemia certainly contributed to the patient's delayed presentation.

In order to establish the diagnosis of insulinoma, I would obtain blood levels of C-peptide, insulin, and β-hydroxybutyrate. For increased sensitivity and specificity, these tests would be performed when the patient's glucose level is less than 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter), ideally when he has symptoms of hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemia may be provoked by a fast (Table 1). The standard duration of the fast is 72 hours to maximize sensitivity. However, two thirds of patients with insulinoma have hypoglycemia within the first day, and 85 to 95% have hypoglycemia within 48 hours. Alternatively, blood tests may be performed opportunistically if hypoglycemia occurs while the patient is in the office or emergency department.

If hypoglycemia is precipitated by fasting and insulinoma is suspected, the next step in the diagnostic process would be to perform imaging studies, such as endoscopic ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If initial imaging studies fail to reveal a tumor, a selective arterial calcium stimulation test or radiolabeled octreotide scan may be used in an attempt to localize the source of the excess insulin to a specific pancreatic segment. If a localized source cannot be found, an alternative diagnosis of the noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome or nesidioblastosis may be considered. The clinician should not perform localization studies until the diagnosis has been established.

Dr. Meridale Baggett (Medicine): Dr. Macias-Konstantopoulos, what was your clinical impression when you initially evaluated this patient in the emergency department?

Dr. Wendy Macias-Konstantopoulos: Our initial differential diagnosis included viral encephalitis, Lyme encephalopathy, neurosyphilis, autoimmune cerebral vasculitis, hepatic encephalopathy, Hashimoto's encephalopathy, and vitamin B12 deficiency. However, if the recurrent self-limiting episodes that had occurred over the preceding 6 years were related to the current presentation, this pattern could also be consistent with substance-use disorder, seizures involving the frontal or temporal lobe, or a psychotic disorder. This broad initial differential diagnosis led to the laboratory evaluation that revealed hypoglycemia, and the patient's cognitive impairment resolved with the administration of oral and intravenous glucose. We suspected a diagnosis of insulinoma, and he was admitted to the medicine service for further diagnostic workup and management.
