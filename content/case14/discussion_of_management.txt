# Discussion Of Management

Dr. Christy E. Cauley: The patient was referred for surgical resection of the insulinoma. The type of resection was based on the tumor location. For insulinomas that are located deep in the pancreatic head, enucleation is not usually an option and pancreatoduodenectomy (the Whipple procedure) is normally performed. However, this patient's insulinoma was abutting the duodenal wall, making him a candidate for transduodenal enucleation. This approach commonly results in the formation of a pancreatic fistula that drains directly into the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 3).

Figure 3. Surgical Resection of the Insulinoma. A Kocher maneuver was performed for duodenal mobilization (Panel A). A firm mass was palpable in the pancreatic head, distal to the ampulla of Vater. A longitudinal anterior duodenotomy was made (Panel B), along with a posterior duodenotomy, revealing the mass. The mass was enucleated (Panel C), leaving behind a cavity. The cavity was connected to the bowel lumen by way of the posterior duodenotomy, and the anterior duodenotomy was closed transversely (Panel D). A drain was placed next to the duodenal repair, and the abdomen and skin were closed.

The operation had a dramatic effect on the patient's ability to maintain euglycemia. The evening after the operation, his glucose level rose to 209 mg per deciliter (11.6 mmol per liter), and by the following day, he could maintain euglycemia. After the operation, his nasogastric tube was removed, and he was transitioned from a liquid diet to a normal diet. His surgical drain had output of serous fluid with a low amylase level and was removed after his transition to a normal diet. He was discharged home on hospital day 7.

Dr. Pierce: Pathological examination of the lesion after surgical resection confirmed the cytologic diagnosis of a well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, grade 1.

Dr. Cauley: Two weeks after discharge, when the patient returned to the clinic for routine post-surgical follow-up, he was recovering well, with no further symptoms of hypoglycemia. We counseled him regarding the 6% risk of recurrent insulinoma within 10 years.
