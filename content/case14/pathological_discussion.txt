# Pathological Discussion

Dr. Kirsten J. Pierce: Cytologic smears that were prepared for rapid interpretation revealed a cellular pattern, with moderately cohesive clusters of relatively monomorphic tumor cells (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Biopsy Specimen. A hematoxylin and eosin stain of a smear prepared for rapid on-site evaluation after biopsy shows the lesion to be cellular, moderately cohesive, and composed of relatively monomorphic cells with moderate amounts of cytoplasm (Panel A). A Papanicolaou stain shows cells with a plasmacytoid appearance and fine stippling of the nuclear chromatin, findings associated with neuroendocrine tumors (Panel B). A hematoxylin and eosin stain of a cell-block preparation shows bland cells that are arranged in vaguely nested architecture, a characteristic appearance of neuroendocrine tumors (Panel C). Approximately 2% of tumor cells stained positive for Ki-67, a finding consistent with a grade 1 tumor (Panel D).

Occasional cells had a plasmacytoid appearance, with an eccentrically placed nucleus reminiscent of a plasma cell, a feature that is often seen in neuroendocrine tumors. Fine stippling of the nuclear chromatin was also visible, further suggesting neuroendocrine lineage. On a cell-block preparation, tumor cells stained positive for synaptophysin, a neuroendocrine marker, confirming their neuroendocrine character. Given the features of the patient's clinical presentation, an insulin stain was also performed, but tumor cells did not stain positive. Although the majority of insulinomas stain positive for insulin on immunohistochemical testing, staining is not always reflective of functional status, and a diagnosis of insulinoma ultimately relies on the results of a fasting study and the patient's symptoms.

The 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Digestive System divides neuroendocrine tumors into well-differentiated and poorly differentiated neoplasms. Examples of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors include small-cell carcinoma and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The rather bland, monomorphic cytologic features of the tumor seen in this case are consistent with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. Well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are graded according to their proliferative activity, with the use of either an immunohistochemical stain for Ki-67 (a proliferation marker) or a mitotic count. A Ki-67 stain of the patient's tumor was performed, and ImageJ software was used for accurate quantification of proliferation (Fig. 1). With this method, the proliferative index was measured as 2%, placing the tumor in the lowest WHO grade (grade 1 of 3, with higher grades indicating more aggressive clinical behavior and worse prognosis; grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors are known as neuroendocrine carcinomas).
