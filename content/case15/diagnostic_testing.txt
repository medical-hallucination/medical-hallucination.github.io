## Diagnostic Testing

Dr. Jason M. Baron: Laboratory testing revealed deficiencies in multiple vitamins and minerals. The patient had markedly low blood levels of folate (2 ng per milliliter; normal range, >4.7), vitamin B6 (<2 μg per liter; normal range, 5 to 50), and vitamin C (<0.1 mg per deciliter [<6 μmol per liter]; normal range, 0.4 to 2.0 mg per deciliter [23 to 114 μmol per liter]). The zinc level was mildly low, and the copper and selenium levels were at the low end of the normal range.

The levels of vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin A, vitamin E, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were not obtained.

In addition to the low serum folate level, this patient had a low red-cell folate level. However, the American Society for Clinical Pathology Choosing Wisely guidelines recommend against obtaining the red-cell folate level.16 The serum folate level can vary according to recent folate intake,17 and thus a normal serum folate level may not rule out folate deficiency in a patient with recent supplementation or dietary intake. In theory, the red-cell folate level has an advantage over the serum folate level in that it may reflect a patient's longer-term folate level (over the period of the red-cell life span) and may be less sensitive to recent folate intake. However, assays for red-cell folate are typically less precise than assays for serum folate,18 and thus in practical terms, obtaining the red-cell folate level usually offers little or no diagnostic advantage over obtaining the serum folate level.16-18 

Although the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not obtained, the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which represents the active form of vitamin D, was normal. However, it is appropriate to obtain the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level to test for vitamin D deficiency.19 Since the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level may be normal even in the context of marked vitamin D deficiency,20 it is not appropriate to obtain the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level to test for vitamin D deficiency. The Endocrine Society Choosing Wisely guidelines recommend against obtaining the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, except for certain limited indications, such as the evaluation of some patients with hypercalcemia or renal disease.20 Taken together, the final pathologic diagnoses in this case were vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), as well as folate, vitamin B6, and zinc deficiencies.
