## Diagnostic Testing

Dr. Jason M. Baron: Laboratory tests identified deficiencies in several vitamins and minerals. The patient had significantly low blood levels of folate (2 ng per milliliter; normal range, >4.7), vitamin B6 (<2 μg per liter; normal range, 5 to 50), and vitamin C (<0.1 mg per deciliter [<6 μmol per liter]; normal range, 0.4 to 2.0 mg per deciliter [23 to 114 μmol per liter]). The zinc level was mildly low, and the copper and selenium levels were at the low end of the normal range.

Levels of vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin A, vitamin E, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were not measured.

Along with the low serum folate level, the patient also had a low red-cell folate level. However, the American Society for Clinical Pathology Choosing Wisely guidelines suggest against obtaining the red-cell folate level. The serum folate level can vary with recent folate intake, and thus, a normal serum level might not eliminate the possibility of folate deficiency in patients who have had recent supplementation or dietary intake. Theoretically, the red-cell folate level could reflect a longer-term folate status (over the red-cell life span) and be less affected by recent intake. However, assays for red-cell folate are often less precise than those for serum folate, and typically, measuring the red-cell folate level doesn't provide a significant advantage over serum folate level testing.

While the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was not obtained, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, which is the active form of vitamin D, was normal. To test for vitamin D deficiency, it is right to obtain the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level because the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level could remain normal despite notable vitamin D deficiency. According to the Endocrine Society Choosing Wisely guidelines, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level shouldn't be measured for vitamin D deficiency unless there are specific conditions, such as certain cases of hypercalcemia or renal disease. Overall, the patient was diagnosed with vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), as well as folate, vitamin B6, and zinc deficiencies.
