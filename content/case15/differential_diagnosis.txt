## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Susan E. Bennett: In this 64-year-old man, fatigue on exertion and leg weakness developed, followed by hypoesthesias and paresthesias in the feet. During a routine clinic visit with his primary care physician, he reported that he had fallen at home but had not lost consciousness. Falls are a commonly encountered problem in primary care; 30% of adults older than 65 years of age fall at least once a year.1,2 When evaluating a patient who has fallen, it is important to determine whether the event was an accident or had an identifiable underlying cause.
