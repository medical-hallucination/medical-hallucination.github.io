## Falls in Older Patients

This patient attributed his fall to tripping over an object in his garage. After a fall, many patients develop a narrative or explanation to normalize the event. Falling is always a surprise to a person with a lifetime of maintaining balance, even in challenging conditions. Maintaining balance after tripping depends on strength in the hip flexor and gluteal muscles, which diminishes with age. When patients describe a fall as "just tripping," it is valuable to ask whether they believe they would have fallen if the same event had occurred 10 or 20 years earlier. Testing for core strength using the "get up and go" test, an assessment of mobility requiring static and dynamic balance, is useful for determining if a patient would benefit from a referral to physical therapy for a strength-training program. This test measures the time needed to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. This patient had osteoarthritis in the knees, and pain in weight-bearing joints can also increase the risk of falling in older adults. Evaluations of this patient's vision, vestibular function, and proprioception may provide valuable insights, as age-related decline in these sensory systems can contribute to postural instability.
