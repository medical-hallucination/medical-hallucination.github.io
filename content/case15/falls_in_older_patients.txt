## Falls In Older Patients

This patient attributed his fall to tripping over an object in his garage. After a fall, many patients develop a narrative or explanation to normalize the event. Falling is always a surprise to a person with a lifetime of experience remaining upright, despite tripping or walking on slippery surfaces. Maintaining balance after tripping is dependent on strength in the hip flexor and gluteal muscles, and such strength decreases gradually with aging. When patients describe a fall as "just tripping," I ask whether they think they would have fallen if the same event had occurred 10 or 20 years earlier. Testing for core strength with the "get up and go" test, an assessment of mobility that requires static and dynamic balance, can help to determine whether a patient would benefit from a referral to physical therapy for a strength-training program; the test measures the time it takes to stand up from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down. This patient had osteoarthritis in the knees, and pain in weight-bearing joints can also increase the risk of falling in older adults. Tests of this patient's vision, vestibular function, and proprioception might be informative, since age-related decline in these sensory systems can contribute to postural instability.
