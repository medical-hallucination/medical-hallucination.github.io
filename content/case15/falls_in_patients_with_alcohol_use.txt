## Falls In Patients With Alcohol Use

If I had seen this patient in the clinic, I would have strongly suspected that his first fall had been related to alcohol intoxication, since he had reported drinking up to 6 or 7 glasses of wine daily during the 3 months before the evaluation. Because he had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, he had a predisposition to the development of a high blood alcohol level within seconds after ingesting alcohol.3 Alcohol-use disorder can occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in patients who have no history of excessive drinking.4 Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration can also lead to a gait disorder and falls but typically occurs after at least a decade of a high level of daily alcohol ingestion.5 Alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy can cause paresthesias and hypoesthesias in the feet, and rapid weight loss can lead to leg weakness; each of these conditions increases the risk of falling.
