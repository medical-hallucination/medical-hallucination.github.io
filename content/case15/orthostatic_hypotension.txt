## Orthostatic Hypotension

Could this patient's recurrent falls have been due to orthostatic (postural) hypotension? An assessment for orthostatic hypotension would be useful, since he was receiving antihypertensives and diuretics, which are common causes of falls in older adults. On admission to the hospital, he was given his usual medications, a multivitamin, a folate supplement, and a thiamine infusion. Within 1 hour after the thiamine infusion, he became profoundly hypotensive. Antihypertensives were discontinued, and intravenous fluids were administered; tests ruled out gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, and sepsis. Although his blood pressure improved over the next 48 hours, he had persistent orthostatic hypotension. Rapid intravenous infusion of thiamine can cause hypotension, but such hypotension is transient. However, this patient had age-related risk factors for falling, with alcohol use being the most concerning.
