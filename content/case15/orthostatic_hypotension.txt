## Orthostatic Hypotension

Could this patient's recurrent falls have been due to orthostatic (postural) hypotension? An assessment for orthostatic hypotension would be useful, since he was receiving antihypertensives and diuretics, and medication side effects such as orthostatic hypotension are another common cause of falls in older adults. On admission to the hospital, he was given his usual medications, as well as a standard multivitamin, a folate supplement, and a thiamine infusion. Within 1 hour after the thiamine infusion, he became profoundly hypotensive. Antihypertensives were discontinued, and intravenous fluids were administered; test results ruled out gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, and sepsis. Although his blood pressure improved over the next 48 hours, he had persistent and substantial orthostatic hypotension for days. Rapid intravenous infusion of thiamine can cause hypotension, but such hypotension is transient. However, this patient had potential age-related risk factors for falling, and his alcohol use was the most worrisome risk factor.
