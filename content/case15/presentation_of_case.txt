Dr. Molly E. Wolf (Medicine): A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of progressive leg weakness, recurrent falls, and anemia.

The patient was in his usual state of health until 8 months before this admission, when fatigue on exertion and subjective leg weakness developed. During the next 3 months, the distance he could walk became progressively shorter, requiring frequent stops due to fatigue and leg weakness. Five months before admission, intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias developed in the feet. Four months before this admission, two lower teeth became loose and fell out without preceding trauma.

The patient experienced a fall in his garage, attributing it to tripping over an object, without hitting his head or needing assistance afterward. He reported increased alcohol consumption (up to 6 or 7 glasses of wine nightly) and restricted food intake for weight loss. Physical examination showed normal vital signs, a height of 166.6 cm, weight of 128.4 kg (previously 140.6 kg), and a body-mass index of 46. Ecchymoses were observed on the knees, and there was gingival bleeding and two absent lower front teeth. He declined referral to an alcohol-cessation program despite counseling.

Over the next 4 months, fatigue and leg weakness progressed. He needed to use his arms to rise from a seated position and had additional falls, describing his legs as "giving out." Two days before admission, he fell while carrying groceries and struck the left side of his face.

At the clinic, the patient reported mild pain above the left eye without headache, neck pain, back pain, urinary retention, fever, or other symptoms. His medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, osteoarthritis, gastroesophageal reflux, and Barrett’s esophagus, with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 6 years earlier. He was on medications including allopurinol, amlodipine, furosemide, and others. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked as a store manager. He did not smoke, and both his father and brother had died of esophageal cancer.

Physical exam revealed a temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure of 139/81 mm Hg, pulse of 98 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Weight was 124.3 kg. There were purple ecchymoses on the left side of the face and left flank, and brown around the right eye. Heart and breath sounds were normal, as were bowel sounds, and the abdomen was soft. Motor strength was reduced in the legs, and perception of pinprick and light touch was diminished in the legs and feet. Proprioception decreased in the big toes. Reflexes were normal. Hair was thin on the arms and absent on the legs. Brown stool was negative for occult blood. He was referred to the emergency department for further evaluation.

In the emergency department, normal blood levels were found for various substances, including calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin B12, and others. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.009 with pH 5 and ketones but no protein, glucose, bilirubin, or blood. HIV tests were negative.

Computed tomography of the head showed soft-tissue swelling on the left side of the face but no fracture or intracranial issues. Chest radiograph was normal aside from degenerative changes. The patient received high-dose thiamine, folate, and a multivitamin. Antihypertensive medications were discontinued, and fluids were administered. Blood pressure improved over 48 hours, and the patient could stand with minimal arm use. Bruising developed on the right forearm due to the catheter.

A diagnostic test was performed.
