## Presentation Of Case

Dr. Molly E. Wolf (Medicine): A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of progressive leg weakness, recurrent falls, and anemia.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 months before this admission, when fatigue on exertion and subjective leg weakness developed. During the next 3 months, the distance he was able to walk became progressively shorter because he frequently needed to stop and rest owing to fatigue and leg weakness. Five months before this admission, intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias developed in the feet. Four months before this admission, two lower teeth became loose and fell out, with no preceding trauma.

Four months before this admission, the patient fell in his garage and attributed the fall to tripping over an object on the ground. He did not hit his head, lose consciousness, or need assistance to stand or walk after the fall. He was evaluated by his primary care provider. On evaluation, he reported 3 months of increased alcohol consumption (up to 6 or 7 glasses of wine each night) and several months of voluntarily restricted food intake to achieve weight loss. On physical examination, the vital signs were normal. The height was 166.6 cm, and the weight was 128.4 kg (6 months earlier, the weight had been 140.6 kg); the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 46. Ecchymoses were present on the knees. Two lower front teeth were absent, and there were areas of gingival bleeding; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The patient was counseled on unhealthy alcohol use, but he declined a referral to an outpatient alcohol-cessation program.

During the next 4 months, fatigue and leg weakness gradually progressed, and the patient needed to use his arms to rise from a seated position. He had three additional falls, which he described as his legs “giving out” while he was walking. Two days before admission, the patient fell while carrying a bag of groceries and struck the left side of his face on the ground.

With each fall, there was no loss of consciousness or associated light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or incontinence. The patient rented a wheelchair to avoid walking long distances and presented to his primary care clinic at this hospital for evaluation.

On evaluation in the clinic, the patient reported mild pain above the left eye but no headache, neck pain, back pain, urinary retention, fecal incontinence, fever, chills, morning stiffness, muscle pain, muscle swelling, dark stools, melena, or hematemesis. He had a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, osteoarthritis of the knees, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Barrett's esophagus, which had been diagnosed by means of biopsy 7 years before this admission. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass had been performed 6 years before this admission. Medications were allopurinol, amlodipine, furosemide, indomethacin, losartan, metoprolol, omeprazole, rivaroxaban, bupropion, cyanocobalamin, ergocalciferol, and a thiamine supplement. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked as a store manager. He did not smoke tobacco. His father and brother had both died of esophageal cancer.

On evaluation in the clinic, the temperature was 36.3°C, the blood pressure 139/81 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 124.3 kg. Purple ecchymoses were present on the left side of the face and left flank, and brown ecchymoses were present around the right eye. Two lower front teeth were absent (Fig. 1A). The first and second heart sounds were normal, without murmurs. The breath sounds were normal bilaterally, without wheezing or rhonchi. Bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender on palpation. The edge of the liver was not palpable, and the spleen was not enlarged. Motor strength was 3 out of 5 bilaterally on hip flexion and 4 out of 5 bilaterally on hip extension; the patient could not rise from a seated position, even when he used his arms for assistance. The remainder of the motor examination was normal. There was no muscle atrophy, swelling, or tenderness on palpation. Perception of pinprick was diminished in the legs from the toes to above the knees. Perception of light touch was diminished on the plantar surface of the feet. Proprioception was decreased in the big toes. Reflexes were normal, as were the results of finger–nose–finger testing. An evaluation for the Babinski sign and a Romberg test were not performed. Hair was thin and fragile on the arms and absent on the legs. The stool was brown and negative for occult blood. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.

In the emergency department, laboratory evaluation revealed normal blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, total protein, albumin, troponin T, creatine kinase, vitamin B12, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.009 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), a pH of 5 (reference range, 5 to 9), and ketones, with no protein, glucose, bilirubin, or blood. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

On admission, the patient was missing two lower teeth and had bleeding gums (Panel A). He also had thinning arm hair and bruised easily (Panel B).

Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed soft-tissue swelling on the left anterior side of the face, with no evidence of fracture, intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, hydrocephalus, or mass lesion. A chest radiograph showed degenerative changes of the bony thorax, with no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

The patient was admitted to the hospital, and a high-dose thiamine infusion, a folate supplement, and a multivitamin were administered, in addition to his usual medications. One hour after admission, the blood pressure was 89/47 mm Hg and the heart rate was 90 beats per minute while the patient was sitting; after he stood up, the blood pressure was 75/40 mm Hg and the heart rate was 100 beats per minute. Amlodipine, furosemide, losartan, and metoprolol were discontinued, and fluids were administered intravenously. Two days later, the blood pressure was 124/72 and the heart rate was 91 beats per minute while the patient was sitting; after he stood up, the blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg and the heart rate was 89 beats per minute. He could rise from a seated position with minimal use of his arms. An area of bruising (10 cm in diameter) developed on the right forearm, where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been placed (Fig. 1B).

A diagnostic test was performed.
