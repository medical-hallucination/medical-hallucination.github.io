## Scurvy

Vitamin C is present in many fruits and vegetables, but proper food preparation is necessary to avoid degrading the vitamin C content. This patient is an example of someone at risk for developing "bachelor scurvy," a condition seen among unpartnered men who prepare their own meals, eat out frequently, drink heavily, and consume virtually no fruits or vegetables. The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey estimated that 14% of men and 10% of women in the United States have vitamin C deficiency.

Unlike most other mammals, humans do not synthesize vitamin C, an essential nutrient necessary for enzymatic reactions, acting as an electron donor and being crucial in catecholamine synthesis. In vitro experiments have shown that vitamin C binds to the alpha-adrenergic receptor, enhancing its activation by epinephrine. Vasomotor instability leading to shock is thought to be a primary cause of sudden death in scurvy patients. This patient's symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, bruising, gingival bleeding with tooth loss, progressive fatigue, and rapid improvement after multivitamin supplementation, suggest scurvy. Heavy alcohol consumption further decreases vitamin C absorption, increasing the likelihood of scurvy development.

Scurvy typically isn't associated with peripheral neuropathy, but other factors like folic acid deficiency and alcohol's detrimental effects on the nervous system could explain this in the patient. This patient was expected to present a more pronounced macrocytic anemia, yet he showed hyponatremia and low urine sodium levels upon admission, hinting at volume contraction. He likely had iron and folate deficiencies, causing a falsely normal mean corpuscular volume. The high red-cell distribution width suggests varying red cell sizes. Iron absorption, facilitated by vitamin C, is also restricted post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Despite lacking the classic cutaneous manifestations of impaired collagen synthesis seen in scurvy, the diagnosis was strongly supported. However, vitamin C deficiency doesn't explain all symptoms. Concurrent vitamin deficiencies likely contributed, necessitating an investigation into the blood vitamin C level for scurvy diagnosis.

Dr. Meridale V. Baggett asked Dr. Schmitt for his initial clinical impression of the patient.

Dr. William P. Schmitt: When the patient first came to my office after his initial fall, I assumed he had merely stumbled. My primary concern was his alcohol consumption. We discussed his drinking habits and their effects extensively. I offered him outpatient treatment for alcohol-use disorder, which he declined.

The patient returned to my clinic four months later in a wheelchair, reporting three additional falls and extensive facial bruising. I referred him to the emergency department for head trauma evaluation and newly detected leg weakness during a neurologic exam. After two days in the hospital, his condition improved significantly with vitamin supplementation. I was reading Patrick O'Brian's *Master and Commander* series at the time, and visiting the patient, I realized he exhibited symptoms akin to scurvy, such as spongy gums, loose teeth, bruising, and hair loss on the arms and legs, as described in Dr. Maturin's patients on Desolation Island. Scurvy could also account for his profound orthostatic hypotension and reduced vascular tone.
