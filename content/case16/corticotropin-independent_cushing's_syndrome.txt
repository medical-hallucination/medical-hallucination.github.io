## Corticotropin-Independent Cushing's Syndrome

Disorders in the adrenal gland that cause excess cortisol production can suppress corticotropin in the pituitary gland. Such corticotropin-independent causes make up approximately 20% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome cases. In this patient, the factors suggesting primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia include the onset age, possible perimenopausal status, and symptom development following the discontinuation of oral contraceptives. This condition involves aberrant expression of luteinizing hormoneâ€“chorionic gonadotropin receptors, leading to excess cortisol production in response to elevated hormone levels. Patients may experience recurrent Cushing's syndrome during pregnancy or post-menopausal persistence, with cortisol normalization upon gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration.

After discontinuation of oral contraceptives, elevated luteinizing hormone levels could have triggered excess cortisol production in this patient due to potential luteinizing hormone receptor aberrancy. Another key corticotropin-independent Cushing's syndrome cause is adrenocortical carcinoma, which often secretes androgens, potentially explaining the patient's hirsutism and androgenic alopecia. Weight loss related to adrenocortical carcinoma was also noted in the patient before fluid retention-induced weight gain. These tumors typically appear large and unilateral on imaging, with contralateral adrenal gland atrophy. 

Adrenal adenomas and bilateral micronodular adrenal hyperplasias are also causes, usually marked by a nodular adrenal gland appearance. This patient's smooth adrenal glands without nodular disease make adult-onset corticotropin-independent Cushing's syndrome an unlikely diagnosis.
