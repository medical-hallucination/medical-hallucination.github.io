## Cushing's Syndrome

Cushing's syndrome refers to a constellation of signs and symptoms that are caused by excess exposure to glucocorticoids. This patient had findings that are typical of Cushing's syndrome, including leukocytosis with lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, anxiety, irritability, and proximal muscle weakness. Some forms of Cushing's syndrome are associated with a risk of venous thrombosis that is 10 times as high as the risk in the general population. Therefore, the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, along with the strong family history of venous thromboses, could explain the development of pulmonary embolism in this patient. In addition, increased cardiac wall thickness has been seen in patients with Cushing's syndrome, even among those who do not have hypertension. This finding may be explained by activation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, particularly in the context of a suspected genetic predisposition to cardiac hypertrophy. Fortunately, among patients with Cushing's syndrome, left ventricular hypertrophy appears to abate with treatment. Some forms of Cushing's syndrome are associated with increased activation of the androgen receptor, which could explain the hirsutism and alopecia in this patient.

What would be the underlying cause of Cushing's syndrome in this case? Cushing's syndrome due to the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids is much more common than endogenous Cushing's syndrome, which has an estimated frequency of fewer than 5 cases per 1 million patient-years. However, glucocorticoid use has not been reported in this patient and would most likely have resulted in adrenal atrophy. The bilateral adrenal enlargement strongly suggests that endogenous Cushing's syndrome is the most likely explanation of her presentation. Causes of endogenous Cushing's syndrome are defined according to corticotropin level.
