## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. J. Carl Pallais: This relatively healthy 45-year- old woman had progressive clinical deterioration that resulted in multiple hospitalizations in a span of 4 weeks. Her presentation included severe hypertension with progressive cardiac hypertro- phy, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. She also had several other signs and symptoms that may provide valuable insight into the underlying pathophysiology of her disorder. I will focus my initial differential diagnosis on the possible causes of severe hypertension, and then I will use the findings on physical exami- nation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to help narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis.

### Hypertension
On the patient’s initial admission to the hospi- tal, 1 month before this admission, she was noted to have severe hypertension (which led to the administration of three antihypertensive medications), evidence of biventricular hypertro- phy on echocardiography, and hypokalemia. These features of her presentation merit an evaluation for causes of hypertension.1-3 She was not taking any medications that are associated with drug- induced hypertension, and her body habitus would not suggest a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Renal vascular disease would be unlikely, given the normal results of duplex ul- trasonography of the renal arterial vasculature that was performed 18 months before this ad- mission. At that time, levels of thyrotropin and plasma metanephrines were also normal, and thus thyroid disease and pheochromocytoma would be unlikely. However, there are two im- portant endocrine disorders that have not been ruled out: primary aldosteronism and Cushing’s syndrome. Cushing’s syndrome is an uncommon cause of hypertension, accounting for less than 1% of cases. Primary aldosteronism is present in more than 20% of patients with medication- resistant hypertension, which makes it a possi- bility in this patient.1-4

### Primary Aldosteronism
Primary aldosteronism is a group of disorders characterized by excess aldosterone production that is independent of the renin–angiotensin sys- tem and is not suppressed by salt loading.4 In this patient, the hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis could have been caused by unregulated aldosterone production that led to excess reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium and hydrogen in the kidney. The pres- ence of hypokalemia during her initial admis- sion is particularly noteworthy, since it occurred while she was taking lisinopril, a drug that promotes potassium retention. Primary aldoste- ronism could also explain the heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy, particularly if she had a genetic susceptibility to myocardial hypertrophy, as suggested by her family history.4-6 Eighteen
months before this admission, the aldosterone level was normal, but the aldosterone level can- not be used to rule out primary aldosteronism without a concurrent measurement of renin activ- ity to determine the aldosterone-to-renin ratio.2,4 Although I would recommend simultaneously ob- taining the aldosterone level and a measurement of renin activity in this patient, there are notable features of her presentation that would not be explained by primary aldosteronism. What other diseases mimic primary aldosteronism?

### Activation of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor
In primary aldosteronism, the hypertension, hypo- kalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are due to aldosterone-induced activation of the mineralo- corticoid receptor in the kidney. Cortisol can also activate the mineralocorticoid receptor, but cortisol is normally converted to inactive corti- sone by the renal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2.7,8 In a state of excess cortisol production, which can occur in Cushing’s syn- drome, the enzyme can be overwhelmed, lead- ing to cortisol-induced activation of the mineralo- corticoid receptor.8,9 Since this patient had other clinical findings that are suggestive of Cushing’s syndrome, I suspect that her hypertension, hypo- kalemia, and metabolic alkalosis were due to activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by excess cortisol.

### Cushing’s Syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome refers to a constellation of signs and symptoms that are caused by excess exposure to glucocorticoids. This patient had findings that are typical of Cushing’s syndrome, including leukocytosis with lymphopenia, hyper- glycemia, altered mental status, anxiety, irrita- bility, and proximal muscle weakness.9-11 Some forms of Cushing’s syndrome are associated with a risk of venous thrombosis that is 10 times as high as the risk in the general population.12 Therefore, the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome, along with the strong family history of venous thromboses, could explain the development of pulmonary embolism in this patient. In addi- tion, increased cardiac wall thickness has been seen in patients with Cushing’s syndrome, even among those who do not have hypertension. This finding may be explained by activation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, particularly in the context of a suspected genetic predisposition to cardiac hypertrophy. Fortunate- ly, among patients with Cushing’s syndrome, left ventricular hypertrophy appears to abate with treatment.13,14 Some forms of Cushing’s syn- drome are associated with increased activation of the androgen receptor, which could explain the hirsutism and alopecia in this patient.10,15
What would be the underlying cause of Cush- ing’s syndrome in this case? Cushing’s syn- drome due to the exogenous administration of glucocorticoids is much more common than endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, which has an estimated frequency of fewer than 5 cases per 1 million patient-years. However, glucocorticoid use has not been reported in this patient and would most likely have resulted in adrenal atro- phy. The bilateral adrenal enlargement strongly suggests that endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is the most likely explanation of her presentation.8-10 Causes of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are defined according to corticotropin level.8-10

### Corticotropin-Independent Cushing’s Syndrome
Any disorder in the adrenal gland that causes excess cortisol production will lead to suppres- sion of corticotropin in the pituitary gland. Corti- cotropin-independent causes account for approxi- mately 20% of cases of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.8-10
In this patient, the age at onset, the possible perimenopausal status, and the development of symptoms after discontinuation of therapy with oral contraceptive pills raise the possibility of primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, which is caused by aberrant expression of the luteiniz- ing hormone–chorionic gonadotropin receptor in the adrenal gland.10 Patients with this condition have excess cortisol production in the adrenal gland in response to elevated levels of luteiniz- ing hormone and chorionic gonadotropin; these patients have been reported to have recurrent Cushing’s syndrome during pregnancy, persistent Cushing’s syndrome after menopause, and nor- malization of the cortisol level after the admin- istration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.16 In this patient, the luteinizing hor- mone level most likely increased after the oral contraceptive pills were discontinued, and the intrauterine system could have masked the pres- ence of menopause, which would also increase
the luteinizing hormone level. If she had aberrant expression of the luteinizing hormone–chorionic gonadotropin receptor in the adrenal gland, it is possible that an increased luteinizing hormone level could have triggered excess cortisol production.

Adrenocortical carcinoma is another important cause of corticotropin-independent Cush- ing’s syndrome. This type of tumor frequently secretes androgens, which could explain the hirsutism and androgenic alopecia in this patient. Adrenocortical carcinoma is also associated with weight loss,10 which was seen in this patient be- fore the development of fluid overload. Four weeks before the current admission, the patient weighed 0.2 kg less than she had weighed 5 months earlier; this weight loss may seem to be mod- est. However, the patient had had rapid weight gain of 4.5 kg during the month before the initial admission, which was most likely due to fluid retention. Therefore, the weight loss over that 5-month period was probably more sub- stantial. Patients with adrenocortical carcino- ma tend to be older than this patient and to have large, unilateral tumors that are easy to detect on imaging studies of the adrenal gland, along with atrophy of the contralateral adrenal gland.
Adrenal adenoma and bilateral micronodular adrenal hyperplasias also cause corticotropin- independent Cushing’s syndrome. However, I would expect the adrenal glands to have a nodular appearance. This patient had bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, with a smooth appearance of the adrenal glands and with no evidence of nodular disease, findings that make any of the causes of adult-onset corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome unlikely.

### Corticotropin-Dependent Cushing’s Syndrome
In corticotropin-dependent Cushing’s syndrome, unregulated corticotropin production drives ex- cess secretion of cortisol and androgens from the adrenal gland.8-10,15 Pituitary corticotroph adenomas that cause excess corticotropin pro- duction (Cushing’s disease) account for approxi- mately 70% of cases of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, and nonpituitary tumors that cause ectopic secretion of corticotropin account for ap- proximately 10% of cases. In rare cases, tumors that cause ectopic secretion of corticotropin- releasing hormone (CRH) can drive excess corti- cotropin production in the pituitary gland.

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, the CRH stimulation test, imaging studies of the pituitary gland, and sampling of blood from the inferior petrosal sinus are some of the tests that are commonly used to distinguish between Cushing’s disease (pituitary adenomas) and other tumors that cause ectopic corticotro- pin or CRH secretion.8-10 I suspect that many of these tests were performed in this patient. Before learning the results, I can note a few clinical fea- tures that suggest she has a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion.

When a pituitary adenoma causes Cushing’s disease, the tumor tends to be responsive to some of the regulatory controls that can suppress cor- ticotropin production. Nonpituitary tumors with ectopic corticotropin secretion generally lack this mechanism for regulatory control, and there- fore, they are typically associated with higher levels of corticotropin, serum cortisol, and 24- hour urinary free cortisol and with more severe metabolic alkalosis, muscle weakness, and throm- boembolic events; all these findings were seen in this patient.

Although this patient had no evidence of hy- perpigmentation, striae, bruising, or infection, the hypokalemia and weight loss are particularly suggestive of a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion. Hypokalemia is present in most patients with Cushing’s syndrome due to a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic corticotro- pin secretion, but it is present in only 10% of patients with Cushing’s disease (pituitary adeno- ma).9,17,18 Weight loss is common in patients with Cushing’s syndrome due to a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion, whereas weight gain and obesity are present in 90% of patients with Cushing’s disease.17,18
Finally, this patient had a florid progression of symptoms — from heart failure and hypoka- lemia to muscle weakness and confusion — over a period of weeks, which also supports the possibility of a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic cor- ticotropin secretion. Patients who have Cushing’s disease tend to have a more gradual progression of symptoms, over a period of months to years, whereas patients who have nonpituitary tumors with ectopic corticotropin secretion progress over a period of weeks to months.9,18

### Ectopic Secretion of Corticotropin
Ectopic corticotropin secretion is most commonly caused by lung tumors, namely small-cell lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid. Other common sources are thymic tumors and pancreatic neuro- endocrine tumors. Somewhat less common sources are medullary thyroid cancer and pheo- chromocytoma, which can occasionally result in the production of CRH.17-21 Many other occult tumors, ranging from parotid tumors to lym- phosarcoma, can cause ectopic corticotropin secretion and lead to Cushing’s syndrome.21,22
In this case, the imaging studies of the chest and abdomen did not reveal a suspicious lesion. In the absence of a tumor in these locations, the most likely source of the ectopic corticotropin secretion would be a thymic tumor, medullary thyroid cancer, or an occult source. However, bronchial carcinoid is sometimes difficult to find, even when dedicated imaging studies are performed. In the absence of additional infor- mation, it would be difficult to clinically localize the source of the ectopic corticotropin or CRH secretion in this patient.
