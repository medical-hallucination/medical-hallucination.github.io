## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. J. Carl Pallais: This relatively healthy 45-year-old woman had progressive clinical deterioration that resulted in multiple hospitalizations in a span of 4 weeks. Her presentation included severe hypertension with progressive cardiac hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. She also had several other signs and symptoms that may provide valuable insight into the underlying pathophysiology of her disorder. I will focus my initial differential diagnosis on the possible causes of severe hypertension, and then I will use the findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to help narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis.
