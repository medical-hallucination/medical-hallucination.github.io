## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. J. Carl Pallais: This relatively healthy 45-year-old woman had progressive clinical deterioration that resulted in multiple hospitalizations over 4 weeks. Her presentation included severe hypertension, progressive cardiac hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. Other signs and symptoms of her disorder may provide insights into its underlying pathophysiology. I will initially address the possible causes of her severe hypertension and use the findings from physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies to narrow it down to the most likely diagnosis.
