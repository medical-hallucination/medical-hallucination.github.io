## Discussion of Diagnostic Testing and Management

Dr. Krzysztof Glomski: The patient had a 24-hour urinary free cortisol level of 18,081 μg (reference range, <45), a finding diagnostic of Cushing's syndrome. She had a corticotropin level in peripheral blood of 512 pg per milliliter (reference range, 6 to 76), a finding indicative of a corticotropin-dependent process.

Dr. Andrew Z. Fenves: On the basis of these findings, the next step in this patient's evaluation was to identify the source of abnormal hormone production. MRI of the head, performed according to a dedicated pituitary protocol, did not reveal any abnormalities in the pituitary gland. Our differential diagnosis included a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion, a nonhypothalamic tumor with ectopic CRH secretion, and iatrogenic exogenous administration of corticotropin, as well as the unlikely possibility of Cushing's disease due to a pituitary microadenoma that had not been visualized on MRI. This final possibility was ruled out by sampling of blood from the inferior petrosal sinus. We thought iatrogenic exogenous administration of corticotropin and a tumor with ectopic CRH secretion were both unlikely. We therefore obtained additional imaging studies to look for a nonpituitary tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion. MRI of the abdomen was negative for a renal or pancreatic mass. Pelvic and renal ultrasonography was similarly unrevealing. Somato statin-receptor scintigraphy was also negative, prompting us to perform positron-emission tomography (PET).

Figure 2. PET–CT of the Chest. Axial CT images of the lower chest, obtained before and after the administration of contrast material (Panels A and B, respectively), show a partially calcified, enhancing nodule (1.8 cm in diameter) in the anterior right mediastinum (arrows). A coronal CT image and a corresponding positron-emission tomographic (PET) image (Panels C and D, respectively) show that the lesion has 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity (arrows).

Dr. Lu: PET–CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intravenous iodinated contrast material, revealed a partially calcified, enhancing nodule (1.8 cm in diameter) with FDG avidity in the right anterior mediastinum (Fig. 2).

Dr. Fenves: The patient continued to have intermittent confusion. Despite therapy with antihypertensive medications, she still had hypertension, which was most likely driven by the markedly elevated serum cortisol level. We thought the nodule that had been identified on PET–CT most likely represented the source of ectopic corticotropin secretion. After a multidisciplinary discussion, we decided to surgically remove the nodule.
