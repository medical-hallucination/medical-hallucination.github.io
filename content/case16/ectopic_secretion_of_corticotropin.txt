## Ectopic Secretion of Corticotropin

Ectopic corticotropin secretion is most commonly caused by lung tumors, namely small-cell lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid. Other common sources are thymic tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Somewhat less common sources are medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma, which can occasionally result in the production of CRH. Many other occult tumors, ranging from parotid tumors to lymphosarcoma, can cause ectopic corticotropin secretion and lead to Cushing's syndrome.

In this case, the imaging studies of the chest and abdomen did not reveal a suspicious lesion. In the absence of a tumor in these locations, the most likely source of the ectopic corticotropin secretion would be a thymic tumor, medullary thyroid cancer, or an occult source. However, bronchial carcinoid is sometimes difficult to find, even when dedicated imaging studies are performed. In the absence of additional information, it would be difficult to clinically localize the source of the ectopic corticotropin or CRH secretion in this patient.
