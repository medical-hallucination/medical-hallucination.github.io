## Ectopic Secretion of Corticotropin

Ectopic corticotropin secretion is most commonly caused by lung tumors, specifically small-cell lung cancer and bronchial carcinoid. Other frequent sources include thymic tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Less common origins are medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytoma, which can occasionally result in CRH production. Various other occult tumors, such as those in the parotid glands or lymphosarcoma, can also lead to ectopic corticotropin secretion and result in Cushing's syndrome.

In this case, imaging studies of the chest and abdomen failed to show a suspicious lesion. Lacking a visible tumor in these locations, the likeliest source of ectopic corticotropin secretion is thought to be a thymic tumor, medullary thyroid cancer, or an undetected source. Notably, bronchial carcinoid can be elusive, even with specialized imaging. Without further information, pinpointing the clinical source of the ectopic corticotropin or CRH secretion in this patient remains challenging.
