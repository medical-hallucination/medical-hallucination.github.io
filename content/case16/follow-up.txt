## Follow-Up

Dr. Fenves: Glucocorticoid replacement therapy was initiated perioperatively, and the patient had no adverse events during the surgical procedure. After surgery, the 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 18 Î¼g. During the postoperative period, the patient had excellent blood pressure control, improvement in mental status, and resolution of hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. After discharge from the hospital, she participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve her exercise tolerance, after which she returned to work. She has not received ongoing glucocorticoid replacement therapy. The plan is to monitor the patient closely and to consider appropriate chemotherapy if her clinical condition changes for the worse.
