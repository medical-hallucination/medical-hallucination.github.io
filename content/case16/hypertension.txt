## Hypertension

On the patient's initial admission to the hospital, 1 month before this admission, she was noted to have severe hypertension (which led to the administration of three antihypertensive medications), evidence of biventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography, and hypokalemia. These features of her presentation merit an evaluation for causes of hypertension. She was not taking any medications that are associated with drug-induced hypertension, and her body habitus would not suggest a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Renal vascular disease would be unlikely, given the normal results of duplex ultrasonography of the renal arterial vasculature that was performed 18 months before this admission. At that time, levels of thyrotropin and plasma metanephrines were also normal, and thus thyroid disease and pheochromocytoma would be unlikely. However, there are two important endocrine disorders that have not been ruled out: primary aldosteronism and Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is an uncommon cause of hypertension, accounting for less than 1% of cases. Primary aldosteronism is present in more than 20% of patients with medication-resistant hypertension, which makes it a possibility in this patient.
