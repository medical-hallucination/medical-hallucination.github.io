## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Glomski: On exploration of the mediastinum, a nodule in the thymus was identified and surgically resected (Fig. 3). Gross examination of the specimen revealed a solid, fleshy, tannish pink mass (1.6 cm in diameter) with a poorly demarcated interface and surrounding thymic fat. On microscopic examination, the mass corresponded to a dense, nested proliferation of cells that had infiltrated into adjacent fat and contained foci of necrosis. At higher magnification, neoplastic cells grew in a nested architecture. The cells had abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and round, regular central nuclei with fine-to-coarse puncta of chromatin (known as a "salt and pepper pattern"), a finding typical of neuroendocrine cells. The cells showed a low level of mitotic activity (1 mitosis per 10 high-power fields). Immunohistochemical staining for synaptophysin (not shown) and chromogranin A showed diffuse positivity; these findings are indicative of a neuroendocrine phenotype. In addition, staining for corticotropin showed diffuse positivity in tumor cells, a finding that implicates the thymic nodule as the source of ectopic corticotropin secretion in this patient. In conjunction with the low mitotic rate, a low Ki-67 proliferation index on immunohistochemical staining supported a diagnosis of a well-differentiated thymic neuroendocrine tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion. This diagnosis was consistent with many of the clinical findings seen in this case (Fig. 4). At the periphery of the tumor, multiple foci of lymphatic invasion were identified, which increased the possibility that residual tumor remained beyond the surgical resection margins.

Figure 3. Resection Specimen. A photograph of the resection specimen (Panel A) shows a tannish pink, fleshy mass (1.6 cm in diameter) (arrows) within soft, yellow, lobulated fatty thymic tissue. The interface between the mass and the thymic fat is irregular, a finding suggestive of infiltrative growth. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel B) shows a highly cellular mass with nested architecture (arrowheads), focal necrosis (asterisks), and infiltration into surrounding adipose tissue (arrows). At higher magnification (Panel C), neoplastic cells have round, regular central nuclei with fine-to-coarse puncta of chromatin (known as a "salt and pepper pattern") (arrows), a finding typical of neuroendocrine differentiation; scattered lymphocytes (arrowheads) are admixed with tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A, a neuroendocrine marker (Panel D), is diffusely and strongly positive in tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining for corticotropin (Panel E) is diffusely positive in tumor cells. On hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel F), tumor cells are visible in lymphatic channels (arrowheads) at a distance from the main tumor mass.
