## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Glomski: On exploration of the mediastinum, a nodule in the thymus was identified and surgi- cally resected (Fig. 3). Gross examination of the specimen revealed a solid, fleshy, tannish pink mass (1.6 cm in diameter) with a poorly demar- cated interface and surrounding thymic fat. On microscopic examination, the mass corresponded to a dense, nested proliferation of cells that had infiltrated into adjacent fat and contained foci of necrosis. At higher magnification, neoplastic cells grew in a nested architecture. The cells had abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and round, regular central nuclei with fine-to-coarse puncta of chromatin (known as a “salt and pepper pat- tern”), a finding typical of neuroendocrine cells. The cells showed a low level of mitotic activity (1 mitosis per 10 high-power fields). Immuno-histochemical staining for synaptophysin (not shown) and chromogranin A showed diffuse positivity; these findings are indicative of a neu- roendocrine phenotype. In addition, staining for corticotropin showed diffuse positivity in tumor cells, a finding that implicates the thymic nod- ule as the source of ectopic corticotropin secre- tion in this patient. In conjunction with the low mitotic rate, a low Ki-67 proliferation index on immunohistochemical staining supported a diag- nosis of a well-differentiated thymic neuroendo- crine tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion. This diagnosis was consistent with many of the clinical findings seen in this case (Fig. 4). At the periphery of the tumor, multiple foci of lymphatic invasion were identified, which increased the possibility that residual tumor remained be- yond the surgical resection margins.
