## Presentation of Case

Dr. Sally A. Ingham (Medicine): A 45-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and confusion.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 18 months before the current admission, when the blood pressure was noted to be 140/90 mm Hg during a routine appointment with her primary care physician. Therapy with oral contraceptive pills was discontinued, but the blood pressure was persistently elevated when it was measured at home and during subsequent clinical evaluations. Results of duplex ultrasonography of the bilateral renal arterial vasculature were normal, as were levels of thyrotropin, plasma free catecholamines, plasma metanephrines, and aldosterone. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal ventricular function, with no evidence of valvular disease or left ventricular hypertrophy; the interventricular septal wall thickness was 11 mm (normal range, 7 to 11). Lisinopril was administered, and the blood pressure decreased to 120/80 mm Hg.

Four weeks before the current admission, swelling of the legs, abdominal distention, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported a weight gain of 4.5 kg during the previous month, occasional episodes of confusion, and two episodes of burning chest pain during exercise that had lasted for 2 minutes each and were relieved with rest. On examination, the temperature was 36.8°C, the blood pressure 180/110 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 66.9 kg; approximately 5 months earlier, at a clinic visit, it had been 67.1 kg. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22. A systolic murmur (grade 2/6) was best heard at the left sternal border. The jugular venous pressure was estimated to be 10 cm of water. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and slightly distended. There was trace nonpitting edema in the legs.
