## Primary Aldosteronism

Primary aldosteronism is a group of disorders characterized by excess aldosterone production that is independent of the reninâ€“angiotensin system and is not suppressed by salt loading. In this patient, the hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis could have been caused by unregulated aldosterone production that led to excess reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium and hydrogen in the kidney. The presence of hypokalemia during her initial admission is particularly noteworthy, since it occurred while she was taking lisinopril, a drug that promotes potassium retention. Primary aldosteronism could also explain the heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy, particularly if she had a genetic susceptibility to myocardial hypertrophy, as suggested by her family history. Although I would recommend simultaneously obtaining the aldosterone level and a measurement of renin activity in this patient, there are notable features of her presentation that would not be explained by primary aldosteronism. What other diseases mimic primary aldosteronism?
