## Clinical Diagnosis

Anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis.

### Diagnostic Testing and Discussion of Management

Dr. Gombolay: On the eighth hospital day, results from the reference laboratory confirmed the presence of anti–NMDA receptor antibodies in serum and CSF specimens, establishing the diagnosis of anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis.

Anti–NMDA receptor antibodies were first identified in 2007 with cases of new-onset psychosis, seizures, and autonomic dysfunction. In those younger than 18 years, common manifestations include behavioral changes and seizures, with movement disorders being common in children under 12. These were seen in this patient. Among adults, the prevalent findings are behavioral changes, seizures, cognitive dysfunction, and memory problems.

Anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis can be associated with tumors, but this is uncommon in young children. Moreover, 94% of tumor-associated cases are female. In this case, imaging studies for tumor evaluation (e.g., thyroid and scrotal ultrasonography, MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) were negative.

First-line treatment includes intravenous glucocorticoids, IVIG, or plasma exchange. When tumors are found, surgical resection is recommended. For this patient, a 5-day course of IVIG was initiated after diagnosis confirmation.

Dr. Pierce: Dr. Thibert, could you share the subsequent developments?

Dr. Ronald L. Thibert: Following the seizure on day five, the patient was moved to the pediatric ICU, administered levetiracetam, and a repeat head MRI was conducted.

Dr. William A. Mehan, Jr.: Diffusion-weighted images and ADC maps indicated symmetric restricted diffusion affecting the cortex and subcortical white matter of the posterior cerebral hemispheres. FLAIR images showed hyperintensity. This implied a differential diagnosis of excitotoxic injury or encephalitis.

Dr. Thibert: Despite treatment with methylprednisolone and more IVIG, there was minimal improvement. Repeat head MRI on the 12th day revealed new hyperintense signals and symmetric restricted diffusion in the bilateral deep gray nuclei and subcortical white matter, consistent with anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis.

On the 13th day, following additional seizures, rituximab weekly treatment began due to the severity and minimal response to first-line treatments, alongside a second 5-day course of IVIG. Episodes of staring and eye fluttering led to long-term EEG monitoring, revealing status epilepticus. Midazolam was started, and clobazam and valproic acid were added to the regimen, with rituximab doses maintained.

By the 22nd day, status epilepticus recurred, necessitating therapies with fosphenytoin and continuous pentobarbital infusion. Waxing and waning status epilepticus persisted, prompting a ketogenic diet and ketamine infusion by day 28, stopping fosphenytoin, clobazam, and valproic acid. EEG findings showed improvement by day 29.

Subsequent tapering of pentobarbital worsened EEG findings. By day 33, seizures re-emerged, leading to restarted pentobarbital and increased midazolam dosage. Seizures resolved, and the midazolam dose was tapered. On day 40, EEG showed high-voltage sharp activity, with clinical worsening noted pre-rituximab treatments. A 7-day methylprednisolone course with prolonged tapering followed, and the ketogenic diet ceased due to glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia. Eventually, pentobarbital, ketamine, and midazolam doses were reduced, stabilizing the patient without seizure recurrence.

Complications included autonomic abnormalities, diabetes insipidus, SIADH, hypertriglyceridemia, and transient hypothyroidism. Supportive care involved placement of gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes. After 3 months, the patient moved to rehabilitation for 2 months, with both tubes removed before home discharge.

**Figure 1. MRI of the Head.** An MRI on the fifth hospital day of the second admission showed an axial diffusion‑weighted image (Panel A) and an axial ADC map (Panel B) with symmetric restricted diffusion (arrows). A FLAIR image (Panel C) revealed hyperintensity affecting the cortex and subcortical white matter of the posterior cerebral hemispheres (arrows). By the 12th hospital day, MRI showed new hyperintense signals and restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia (Panel F, arrows) and cerebellar hemispheres (not shown).

On follow-up 6 months post-first presentation, the movement disorder had resolved. Gross motor skills approached baseline, as did fine motor skills. The patient continued to have sleep difficulties and hyperactivity, with ongoing speech delay but notable progress.

Dr. Pierce: Dr. Mehan, are normal head MRI results typical for anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis?

Dr. Mehan: MRI results are reportedly normal in half of these cases. In others, T2-weighted FLAIR images may reveal hyperintensity in the hippocampi, cerebral or cerebellar cortex, basal ganglia, brain stem, and spinal cord, findings observed later in this patient's course. Less common findings include contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion, with reversible brain atrophy occasionally seen.
