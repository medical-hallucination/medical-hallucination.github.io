## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Mark P. Gorman: This 3-year-old boy had two admissions to the hospital: the first due to a seizure, and the second due to symptoms that developed during the week following his discharge. These symptoms included decreased language output, lethargy, labile mood, aggressive behavior, and unsteady gait. During the second admission, a movement disorder characterized by orofacial dyskinesias was observed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. By reviewing this information, we can formulate a differential diagnosis.
