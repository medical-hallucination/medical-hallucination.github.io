## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Mark P. Gorman: This 3-year-old boy had two admissions to this hospital: an initial admission because of a first-time seizure, and a second admission because of symptoms that had developed during the week after discharge, including decreased language output, lethargy, labile mood, aggressive behavior, and unsteady gait. During the second admission, a movement disorder (including orofacial dyskinesias) became apparent, and CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Through synthesis of all this information, we can construct a differential diagnosis.
