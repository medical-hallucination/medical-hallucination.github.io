## Encephalitis With Movement Disorder

Intermittent stereotyped arm movements, athetoid hand movements, and orofacial dyskinesias subsequently developed in the patient. On the basis of the EEG results, these abnormal movements were not due to seizure activity. The presence of this mixed movement disorder allows us to further focus the differential diagnosis. Data from the California Encephalitis Project suggest that persons with encephalitis and movement or extrapyramidal disorders are most likely to have one of several infectious or postinfectious causes (e.g., measles, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, enterovirus, varicella–zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, or Sydenham's chorea) or noninfectious causes (e.g., lymphoma, small-cell lung cancer, or ovarian teratoma). Of note, in a retrospective analysis involving patients with encephalitis and dyskinesias or movement disorders without a previously identified cause, anti–NMDA receptor antibodies were present in half of the patients. It is now understood that anti–NMDA receptor antibodies are a common cause of encephalitis with movement disorder and, more broadly, were the most commonly identified cause of encephalitis among patients 30 years of age or younger in the California Encephalitis Project. Therefore, testing for anti–NMDA receptor antibodies should be considered early during the evaluation of young patients with encephalitis, particularly those with a presentation similar to that seen in this case.
