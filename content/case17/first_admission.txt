## First Admission: First-Time Seizure

The initial presentation of the patient includes several indicative features. First, the vomiting and diarrhea prior to the seizure suggest possible diagnoses, such as viral gastroenteritis, with or without dehydration or electrolyte imbalances; benign convulsions with gastroenteritis; a postinfectious inflammatory or autoimmune disorder of the CNS; or a concurrent gastrointestinal and CNS infection. Second, the decreased language output before the seizure, likely localized to the frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere, expands the differential diagnosis to include stroke, encephalitis (especially herpes simplex virus or anti–NMDA receptor antibodies), unrecognized seizures, and Landau–Kleffner syndrome. Third, the low-grade fever approximately 18 hours post-seizure is atypical for febrile seizures, suggesting a CNS infection or inflammatory disorder. Lastly, despite a normal MRI, the EEG showed continuous focal delta slowing and sharp wave discharges over the right frontal region, correlating with observed seizure symptoms. These findings raise concerns about encephalitis as the cause, with an autoimmune or infectious origin being most likely.
