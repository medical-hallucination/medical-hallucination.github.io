## First Admission: First-Time Seizure

Although there are many causes of seizure, several features of this patient's initial presentation may offer helpful clues in this case. First, the vomiting and diarrhea that preceded the initial seizure raise several diagnostic possibilities, including viral gastroenteritis, with or without dehydration or electrolyte abnormalities that lower the threshold for seizure in a susceptible host; benign convulsions with gastroenteritis; a postinfectious inflammatory or autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS); or a concurrent gastrointestinal and CNS infection. Second, the decreased language output that occurred on the day before the seizure, which was probably localized to the frontal lobe of the dominant (usually left) hemisphere, broadens the differential diagnosis to include stroke, encephalitis (particularly encephalitis associated with herpes simplex virus or anti–N-methyl-d-aspartate [NMDA] receptor antibodies), unrecognized seizures, and the Landau–Kleffner syndrome (a rare form of epilepsy that is characterized by progressive language dysfunction in young children with previous age-appropriate development). Third, the low-grade fever that occurred approximately 18 hours after the seizure is of a lower magnitude and later onset than would be expected in a patient with a febrile seizure, and it prompts consideration of a CNS infection or inflammatory disorder, especially in the absence of a clear systemic source of fever. Finally, although the limited results of MRI of the head were normal, EEG showed continuous focal delta slowing and sharp wave discharges over the right frontal region, findings that correlate with the leftward deviation of the head and left-side predominant clonic movements that were observed with the seizure. Thus, although the normal physical examination is reassuring, the vomiting and diarrhea, decreased language output, fever, and focal abnormalities on EEG all raise concerns about encephalitis as the cause of seizure in this patient and suggest that an autoimmune or infectious cause is most likely.
