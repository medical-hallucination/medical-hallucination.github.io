## Encephalitis with Movement Disorder

Intermittent stereotyped arm movements, athetoid hand movements, and orofacial dyskinesias subsequently developed in this patient. EEG results indicated these abnormal movements were not due to seizure activity. The presence of this mixed movement disorder allows further focus on differential diagnosis. Data from the California Encephalitis Project suggests that persons with encephalitis and movement or extrapyramidal disorders are likely to have infectious or postinfectious causes (e.g., measles, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, enterovirus, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus 6, *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, or Sydenham's chorea) or noninfectious causes (e.g., lymphoma, small-cell lung cancer, or ovarian teratoma). Notably, a retrospective analysis involving patients with encephalitis and dyskinesias or movement disorders without a previously identified cause found anti–NMDA receptor antibodies in half the patients. It is understood that anti–NMDA receptor antibodies are a common cause of encephalitis with movement disorder and the most commonly identified cause of encephalitis in patients 30 years or younger in the California Encephalitis Project. Therefore, testing for anti–NMDA receptor antibodies should be considered early during the evaluation of young patients with encephalitis, particularly those with a presentation similar to this case.
