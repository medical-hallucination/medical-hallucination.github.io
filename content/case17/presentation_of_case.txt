## Presentation Of Case

Dr. Caitlin E. Naureckas Li (Pediatrics): A 3-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital during the summer because of a seizure.

The patient had been well until 3 days before admission, when one episode of emesis occurred. The following evening, he was fussy, and on the third day of illness, he had decreased language output and one loose bowel movement. That evening, he told his mother that he wanted to sleep, which was atypical behavior. One minute after the patient lay down, he suddenly sat up; his whole body stiffened, and he did not respond to his name being called. His mother noted that he felt warm to the touch, that his head was turned to the left, and that he appeared to be "staring off into space." Both arms were flexed, and there were shaking movements of the arms and legs that were greater on the left side than on the right side. After 1 minute, the movements stopped and the patient vomited; he seemed to be confused and then fell asleep. Emergency medical services were called. On examination 10 minutes later, he was somnolent but arousable and had spontaneous movements of the arms and legs. He vomited again and was transported to the emergency department of another hospital, arriving 25 minutes after the episode.

On examination, the patient was alert, active, and in no apparent distress. The temperature was 36.9°C; other vital signs were normal. The weight was 15.8 kg (71st percentile). Strength, sensation, coordination, and cranial-nerve function were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 105 mg per deciliter (5.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]).

he currently knew at least 200 words and spoke in full sentences. He had not received vaccines for Streptococcus pneumoniae, *Haemophilus influenzae* type b, hepatitis B virus, or rotavirus because of parental refusal; he had received other routine childhood vaccines. He did not take any medications or have any known allergies. He lived with his parents and siblings in an urban area of New England. There were no pets at home. There was no family history of seizures.

On examination, the patient was sleeping; he awoke when touched and pushed the examiner away. The temperature was 37.4°C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 100/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light, decreasing from 3 mm to 2 mm in diameter; there was no ptosis. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. Muscle bulk and tone were normal, as was strength. The patient withdrew from tickling. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ throughout, and plantar reflexes were flexor. The remainder of the examination was normal. The red-cell count, red-cell indexes, platelet count, and results of renal- and liver-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, and magnesium; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed, and a T2-weighted single-shot turbo spin-echo image showed normal ventricles and no extraaxial fluid collection, mass lesion, or midline shift. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed 12 hours after the seizure, revealed continuous focal polymorphic delta slowing and occasional broad sharp wave discharges over the right frontal region. That afternoon, the patient's temperature was 38.2°C; acetaminophen was administered. He was observed overnight and had no seizure activity, and the following morning, he was discharged home.

One week after discharge, the patient was taken back to the emergency department of the other hospital. His mother reported that he had been well for the 2 days after discharge, but for the past 5 days, he had had progressively decreased language output, increased sleep (such that he was now sleeping for most of the day, awakening for only 10 minutes at a time), decreased oral intake, and constipation that could not be relieved by orally administered polyethylene glycol. During the past 2 days, mood lability had developed; there had been periods when he seemed enraged and was physically and verbally aggressive toward family members, as well as periods when he laughed hysterically, and these moods had not been provoked. He had babbled, repeated unusual phrases, and lost interest in games, toys, and videos; his gait had become increasingly unsteady, with frequent tripping. On the day of this presentation, writhing movements had occurred after he ate and drank; his mother thought these movements might have been caused by abdominal pain. In addition, his urine output had decreased.

On examination, the patient was quiet, with a flat affect and subdued behavior. Vital signs were normal; the weight was 14.7 kg (48th percentile). The oral mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was soft and flat, without tenderness; bowel sounds were normal. The patient followed some commands and then fell asleep during the examination. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 76 mg per deciliter (4.2 mmol per liter), and abdominal radiography revealed feces in the colon, without evidence of obstruction. Normal saline was administered intravenously; 1 hour later, the red-cell count, red-cell indexes, platelet count, results of renal- and liver-function tests, and venous blood gas measurements were normal, as were blood levels of glucose, calcium, magnesium, thyrotropin, and free thyroxine. A serum toxicology screen was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed increased bowel gas, without evidence of intussusception. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

In the emergency department, the patient was somnolent but aroused in response to voice; he made only limited eye contact with his parents and the examiner and had unintelligible speech. There was one unprovoked episode of agitation and screaming. Vital signs were normal. The pupils were round, equal, and reactive to light, decreasing from 5 mm to 2 mm in diameter. He blinked in response to threat bilaterally. Extraocular movements were intact, without nystagmus. The face was symmetric, and the tongue was midline. The neck was supple. The patient moved the arms and legs equally and had normal strength and normal sensation to light touch. Deep-tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout. Plantar reflexes were flexor. The gait was unsteady and ataxic. The remainder of the examination was normal. A sodium phosphate-based enema was administered, and the patient had a large bowel movement. He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The following day, magnetic resonance angiography of the head was normal. MRI of the head and spine was performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images revealed a small number of scattered, punctate, nonspecific hyperintense foci in the white matter of the brain and mild, scattered mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinus, without other abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed; the results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 2. A plasma sample was sent for acylcarnitine profile analysis, and tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus antigens were negative. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.017, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ ketones. Intravenous fluids, acyclovir, and oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered.

During the third and fourth hospital days, the patient had episodes of irritability, thrashing, and screaming, as well as intermittent stereotyped arm movements, athetoid hand movements, and orofacial dyskinesias. Video EEG revealed generalized polymorphic slowing of the resting background (at a rate of 2 to 5 Hz), even while the patient was in a maximally awake state; the abnormal movements had no correlate on EEG. On the morning of the fifth hospital day, apnea occurred, with associated tachycardia, hypertension, opisthotonic posturing, and jaw clenching. Ventilation with a bag-valve-mask device was difficult to administer. Midazolam, fentanyl, and rocuronium were administered intravenously, the trachea was intubated, and mechanical ventilation was begun; thereafter, the posturing resolved and vital signs normalized. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).

A diagnosis and management decisions were made.
