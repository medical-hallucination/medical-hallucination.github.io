## Second Admission: Encephalitis

After a brief hospital stay that followed the seizure, the patient was discharged home, where his clinical status deteriorated. The course was characterized by progressively abnormal language function, lethargy, aggressiveness, and spells of unprovoked laughter (which could have been seizures or hallucinations). On readmission to the hospital, CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. This new information confirms that the patient meets the criteria for a diagnosis of encephalitis. Encephalitis can be defined as the presence of encephalopathy (depressed or altered level of consciousness lasting for 24 hours, lethargy, or personality change) along with at least one additional feature: fever, seizure, focal neurologic findings, pleocytosis on CSF analysis, or findings consistent with encephalitis on EEG or neuroimaging studies.
