## Second Admission: Encephalitis

After a brief hospital stay that followed the seizure, the patient was discharged home, where his clinical status deteriorated. The course was characterized by progressively abnormal language function, lethargy, aggressiveness, and spells of unprovoked laughter (which could have been seizures or hallucinations). On readmission to the hospital, CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. How does this new information help us to focus the differential diagnosis? At this stage, it is clear that the patient meets the criteria for a diagnosis of encephalitis, which can be defined as the presence of encephalopathy (a depressed or altered level of consciousness that lasts for 24 hours, lethargy, or personality change) in addition to at least one of the following features: fever, seizure, focal neurologic findings, pleocytosis on CSF analysis, or findings consistent with encephalitis on EEG or neuroimaging studies.
