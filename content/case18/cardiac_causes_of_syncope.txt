## Cardiac Causes of Syncope

This patient's sudden collapse with associated facial trauma suggests a cardiac arrhythmic cause of syncope as a primary consideration. Typical clues for arrhythmia include the sudden onset of symptoms without a prodrome and the absence of symptoms after the event. Arrhythmic causes of syncope can include bradyarrhythmias (such as sick sinus syndrome or high-grade atrioventricular block) and tachyarrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia or, less likely, supraventricular tachycardia). In this patient, the electrocardiogram obtained on presentation did not show evidence of bradyarrhythmia. Due to his history of coronary artery disease, assessing left ventricular systolic function was crucial to determine the risk of ventricular arrhythmia; the TTE showed subtle inferior wall dysfunction within the context of a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, a finding that reduces the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmia.

Other cardiac causes of syncope can be mechanical, including valvular disorders (such as aortic stenosis), myocardial abnormalities (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe heart failure), pericardial disease (such as effusion and tamponade), and vascular causes (such as pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection). However, this patient had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction on TTE, despite having an inferior wall-motion abnormality. There was no evidence of hemodynamically significant valvular disease or pericardial effusion, and normal right ventricular size and function, findings that are inconsistent with a mechanical cause of his syncope.
