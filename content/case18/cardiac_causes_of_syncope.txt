## Cardiac Causes Of Syncope

This patient's sudden collapse with associated facial trauma makes a cardiac arrhythmic cause of syncope a primary consideration. Typical clues for arrhythmia include the sudden onset of symptoms without a prodrome and the absence of symptoms after the event. Arrhythmic causes of syncope include bradyarrhythmia (e.g., sick sinus syndrome or high-grade atrioventricular block) and tachyarrhythmia (e.g., ventricular tachycardia or, less likely, supraventricular tachycardia). In this patient, the electrocardiogram obtained on presentation did not show evidence of bradyarrhythmia. Given his history of coronary artery disease, an assessment of left ventricular systolic function was important to help determine the risk of ventricular arrhythmia; the TTE showed subtle inferior wall dysfunction in the context of a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, a finding that lowers the likelihood of ventricular arrhythmia.

Other cardiac causes of syncope are mechanical, including valvular disorders (e.g., aortic stenosis), myocardial abnormalities (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe heart failure), pericardial disease (e.g., effusion and tamponade), and vascular causes (e.g., pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection). However, this patient had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction on TTE (although he had an inferior wall-motion abnormality), no evidence of hemodynamically significant valvular disease or pericardial effusion, and normal right ventricular size and function, findings that are not consistent with a mechanical cause of his syncope.
