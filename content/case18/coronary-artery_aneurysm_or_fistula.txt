## Coronary-Artery Aneurysm or Fistula

What else can cause an extracardiac mass on the right side of the heart? Since most disorders of the mediastinum are unlikely in this case, we must focus on the general anatomical area external to the right side of the heart, including the right coronary artery. Coronary arteries can develop an aneurysm, defined as a dilatation that exceeds 1.5 times the diameter of the largest coronary artery. The causes of coronary-artery aneurysm include congenital factors and connective-tissue diseases. However, this patient underwent coronary angiography before CABG, with no mention of aneurysm.

Kawasaki's disease (mucocutaneous lymph-node syndrome) is often considered in the differential diagnosis for coronary-artery aneurysm. Typically presenting with a febrile illness in infancy or childhood, the aneurysm associated with Kawasaki's disease usually develops weeks after illness onset. Around 50% of the cases experience aneurysm regression, with the lumen returning to a normal diameter. Any past occurrence related to Kawasaki's disease would likely have been noted at the time of angiography or CABG.

In adults, atherosclerosis is the most common cause of coronary-artery aneurysm. This patient has a history of coronary artery disease and ongoing risk factors. Other causes like trauma, dissection, and complications from percutaneous coronary intervention are not applicable here. An alternative consideration is a coronary–cameral fistula, which is an abnormal connection between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber. It often involves the right coronary artery with a chamber on the right side of the heart. Patients with coronary–cameral fistula might experience myocardial ischemia or left-to-right blood shunting if the fistula terminates on the right side of the heart, though these were not observed in the patient's prior angiography.
