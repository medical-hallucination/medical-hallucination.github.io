## Diagnostic Evaluation

After a detailed history and physical examination, diagnostic studies are typically performed to evaluate syncope. These studies, however, often do not provide a definitive diagnosis in nearly half of the cases. In this instance, the most informative test was a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), which identified masses external to the right atrioventricular groove. These masses showed evidence of exerting external compression on the heart. This unusual echocardiographic finding may provide significant clues into the underlying cause of the patient's syncopal episodes.
