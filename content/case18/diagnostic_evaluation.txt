## Diagnostic Evaluation

After a detailed history is obtained and a physical examination is done, diagnostic studies are typically performed as part of the syncope evaluation. However, the yield from such studies is limited; a diagnosis is not established in nearly one half of cases. The most informative test in this case was TTE, which revealed masses external to the right atrioventricular groove, with evidence of external compression of the heart. Focusing on this unusual echocardiographic finding may ultimately reveal the cause of this patient's syncope.
