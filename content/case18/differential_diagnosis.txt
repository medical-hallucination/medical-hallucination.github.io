## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Rory B. Weiner: This 63-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease presented with syncope. The most notable features of the episode were that his wife had heard a thud and that he had sustained facial trauma from the collapse. These features raise concerns about a cardiac, specifically arrhythmic, cause of syncope.

The first step in the evaluation of this patient is to determine whether he had another cardiac arrest or a syncopal event. Cardiac arrest seems unlikely, since patients with cardiac arrest typically need to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation for the spontaneous circulation to return. In this case, the patient's wife performed chest compressions for a few seconds and then the patient could answer questions; this sequence of events is not consistent with cardiac arrest.

This patient most likely had a true syncopal event, defined as the transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion. The differential diagnosis for syncope can be divided into several categories, including cardiac (arrhythmic or nonarrhythmic) causes, reflex syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and conditions that mimic syncope (i.e., neurologic disorders, such as seizure, stroke, or transient ischemic attack).
