Cine steady-state free precession images of the left ventricle, obtained in the short-axis view during systole and diastole (Panels A and B, respectively), show superior (asterisk) and inferior (plus sign) aneurysmal segments that are compressing the right ventricle and impairing ventricular filling. A T2-weighted, double inversion recovery image of the left ventricle, obtained in the short-axis view without the administration of contrast material (Panel C), shows superior (asterisk) and inferior (plus sign) aneurysmal segments with heterogeneous internal signal intensity, a finding consistent with thrombus and the presence of blood products of varying ages. A T1-weighted, double inversion recovery image, obtained orthogonal to the aneurysmal segments, without the administration of contrast material (Panel D), shows heterogeneous internal signal intensity in the inferior aneurysmal segment (plus sign). Curved planar reformation images from a magnetic resonance angiogram, obtained after the administration of gadolinium-based contrast material (Panels E and F), show an internal continuous patent lumen within a coronary-artery bypass graft; the dashed line represents the outer contour of the superior (asterisk) and inferior (plus sign) aneurysmal segments.

A mechanical complication, such as compression of mediastinal structures or impending rupture or fistula involving the saphenous-veinâ€“graft aneurysm, is an indication for aneurysmectomy. Repeat revascularization is also indicated when evidence of ischemia is present. This patient had mechanical compression of the right side of the heart, along with evidence of ischemia on the initial electrocardiogram, new inferior wall dysfunction on echocardiography, and flow through a patent saphenous-vein graft on angiography, and therefore, repeat sternotomy with bypass grafting was performed.
