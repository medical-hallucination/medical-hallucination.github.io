## Figure 3. Preoperative and Intraoperative Imaging Studies

An image from a preoperative coronary angiogram (Panel A) shows a large proximal aneurysmal segment (superior segment; asterisk) with poor but intact distal flow. The dashed line outlines the location of a second, more distal aneurysmal segment (inferior segment; plus sign). Images from an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram, obtained with an X-plane technique in the midesophageal bicaval view (Panel B), show two masses that are abutting the tricuspid annulus and compressing the right atrium. The superior mass (asterisks) is at the level of the aortic valve. The inferior mass (plus sign) has an echolucent core (arrow). SVC denotes superior vena cava. More focused images of the inferior mass, obtained with an X-plane technique in the transgastric view (Panel C, plus signs), show a complex internal structure with heterogeneous echotexture and multiple echolucent areas, findings that represent a partially thrombosed aneurysmal vessel lumen.
