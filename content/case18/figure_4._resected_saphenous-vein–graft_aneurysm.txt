The aneurysm was removed in two portions (Panels A and B). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the aneurysm wall (Panel C) shows atherosclerosis (Ath) with foam cells (arrowheads) and an organizing luminal thrombus (Th). Immunohistochemical staining shows infiltration of the media by cells expressing the macrophage marker CD68 (Panel D, in brown), trichrome staining shows scarring in the media (Panel E, in blue), and elastic staining shows fragmentation and loss of elastic fibers (Panel F, in black).
