## Follow-Up

Dr. Hucker: The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and he did well for 4.5 years. He then presented with presyncope in the context of excessive alcohol consumption and opiate use, and he was found to have frequent ventricular ectopy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with anterolateral ST-segment depressions. Angiography revealed a patent saphenous-vein graft to the posterior descending artery, with normal flow and caliber, but also revealed progression of native coronary artery disease, including severe stenosis of the ramus intermedius and circumflex arteries. Echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging confirmed lateral-wall dysfunction and ischemia, and staged percutaneous coronary intervention of both arteries was performed. An implantable loop recorder was placed for assessment of ventricular dysrhythmia, and no arrhythmias were detected after 1 year of follow-up.
