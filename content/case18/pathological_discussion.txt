## Pathological Discussion

Dr. James R. Stone: The saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm was removed surgically in two sections (Fig. 4A and 4B). On histologic examination of the specimens, the graft wall showed evidence of atherosclerosis and there was an organizing thrombus in the lumen (Fig. 4C). In the remaining medial layer of the graft, there was infiltration by macrophages (Fig. 4D) and scarring (Fig. 4E), with destruction of the elastic lamina (Fig. 4F). Saphenous-vein grafts often show scarring in the medial layer and atherosclerosis after 1 year. Case reports of the histologic features of saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm often note the scarring of the graft wall. As this case shows, there may also be macrophage-rich inflammatory infiltrates in saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm that are similar to those seen in aneurysms found at other sites in the body.
