## Saphenous-Vein–Graft Aneurysm

The patient had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with saphenous-vein grafting to the right coronary artery. The failure rate is higher with saphenous-vein grafts than with internal-mammary-artery grafts. Aneurysm is an unusual complication of saphenous-vein grafts. In a review of over 5500 saphenous-vein grafts, the estimated incidence of aneurysm was 0.07%, which may be a low estimate, as this condition is often clinically silent.

A systematic review of saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm showed it typically arises about 13 years after bypass surgery, more commonly occurring in men during the sixth decade of life. Aneurysmal saphenous-vein grafts most commonly target the right coronary artery (38% of cases). Larger aneurysms increase the risk of complications, with the average size at identification being 6.0 cm. Symptoms are more likely when the aneurysm is larger, due to compression of adjacent structures like heart chambers, great vessels, or the bronchial tree. External compression of the right atrium or ventricle occurs in about 20% of cases. More than half the cases present with chest pain or shortness of breath, while about one third are discovered incidentally. Myocardial infarction presents as a symptom in roughly 8% of cases, while heart failure and syncope each occur in about 2%. Saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm is the leading consideration in this patient.

To diagnose, it is necessary to assess aneurysm size, graft patency, and status of the native coronary artery, along with the effect on adjacent structures. Angiography may be limited if there's an intraluminal thrombus or a thrombosed aneurysm. Cardiac CT is the preferred test to confirm the diagnosis, with cardiac MRI as an alternative. For this patient, one possible cause of syncope could be external cardiac compression due to alcohol-related dehydration and orthostatic hypotension, with myocardial ischemia leading to arrhythmia being another possible cause. However, the hemodynamic explanation seems more probable based on TTE findings.

Dr. Dudzinski: Dr. Hucker, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this patient?

Dr. Hucker: Our clinical diagnosis was syncope due to insufficient ventricular preload in the context of decreased venous return caused by excessive alcohol consumption and furosemide use, compounded by impaired filling on the heart's right side due to external compression from a saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm.
