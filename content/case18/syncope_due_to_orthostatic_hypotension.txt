## Syncope Due To Orthostatic Hypotension

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension typically causes syncope during a change in body position. Factors that confer a predisposition to orthostatic hypotension include dehydration caused by diuretic use or inadequate fluid intake. Autonomic insufficiency due to Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, or alcohol use may play a role. The patient's history of heavy alcohol use makes this diagnosis a consideration. Many medications may promote orthostasis, including antihypertensive agents (beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and nitrates), opiates, and psychoactive agents. This patient was taking a diuretic and a beta-blocker, which may have influenced his effective circulating volume and ability to compensate for orthostatic changes.
