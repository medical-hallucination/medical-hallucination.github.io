## Syncope Due to Orthostatic Hypotension

Orthostatic hypotension typically causes syncope during a change in body position. Factors that predispose to orthostatic hypotension include dehydration from diuretic use or inadequate fluid intake. Autonomic insufficiency from Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, or alcohol use may also play a role. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption makes this diagnosis a consideration. Medications contributing to orthostasis can include antihypertensives (beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates), opiates, and psychoactive substances. This patient was on a diuretic and a beta-blocker, which may have influenced his circulating volume and ability to handle orthostatic changes.
