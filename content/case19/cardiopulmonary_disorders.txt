## Cardiopulmonary Disorders

Cardiac and pulmonary disorders can lead to delirium through hypoxemia or hypercarbia. Although I do not have access to results of tests of arterial blood gases for this patient, there is no history of lung disease that would raise suspicion for these abnormalities. In addition, I have not seen the results of electrocardiography for this patient, but she did not report chest pain and she had a normal troponin T level, and these findings make myocardial infarction unlikely. She had evidence of rales on pulmonary auscultation, mild pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiography, and an elevated level of N-terminal proâ€“B-type natriuretic peptide, findings that indicate a component of congestive heart failure. However, her oxygen saturation was normal, and thus it is unlikely that a cardiac or pulmonary process would be the main driver of her delirium.
