## Diagnostic Testing

Dr. Rory K. Crotty: The diagnostic test in this case was a digoxin immunoassay. Testing of a blood sample obtained in the emergency department revealed a digoxin level of 9.0 ng per milliliter (therapeutic range, 0.9 to 2.0). The international normalized ratio was more than 16.

The digoxin level is frequently monitored because of the narrow therapeutic range and the potential for serious adverse drug events. This patient was also taking spironolactone, which has historically been reported to interfere with testing of the digoxin level by acting as a digoxinlike immunoreactive substance. The term digoxinlike immunoreactive substance encompasses a broad range of substances, both exogenous and endogenous in origin, that may interfere with digoxin immunoassays.14 Endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances may be found in patients with volume expansion and appear to have natriuretic effects. Exogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances include spironolactone, canrenone, and Chinese herbal medications. However, spironolactone and related medications are not known to cause interference with the current generation of digoxin immunoassays that are used at this hospital.

In cases in which the desired diagnostic test is a digoxin immunoassay, a blood sample must be obtained before the administration of digoxinbinding antibody fragments. The digoxin level cannot be meaningfully measured until these antibody fragments are eliminated from the body, which may take days to more than a week in patients with severe kidney dysfunction.
