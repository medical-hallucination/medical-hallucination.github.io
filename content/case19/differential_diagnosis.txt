## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Melissa L.P. Mattison: This 83-year-old woman was brought by her family to this hospital for an evaluation of global weakness in the context of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which began to occur after she had had symptoms that were suggestive of an upper respiratory infection for several days. She was newly unable to recognize family members and to answer questions. Using the common classification of organ failure as acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic, I would characterize her condition as acute brain failure.1,2

The patient's daughter had set out the patient's pills, but I do not know whether she did this because the patient was no longer capable of doing so owing to cognitive impairment or because the patient had a low level of health literacy or language-barrier issues. Although the patient clearly had an acute alteration of mental status, I would need more background information to determine whether her current condition could represent an acute-on-chronic process. Regardless, the features of her presentation are consistent with delirium according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) definition.3 She had acute inattention (intermittent following of commands), disorganized thinking (inability to recognize family members), and an altered level of consciousness (global weakness and lethargy).
