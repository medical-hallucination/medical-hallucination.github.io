## Discussion Of Management

Dr. Christopher Newton-Cheh: I met this patient shortly after her emigration from Uganda, 19 years before this admission. She reportedly had had persistent atrial fibrillation for years, which was not surprising given her symptomatic mitralvalve stenosis, left atrial enlargement, and resultant scarring from chronic pressure overload. I presume that digoxin and a beta-blocker had initially been prescribed in Uganda for control of the heart rate in the context of atrial fibrillation and that these treatments were continued when heart failure subsequently developed.

Cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin, were first used for the treatment of heart failure many years ago,15 well before the molecular actions of these drugs were understood. If this patient presented today with atrial fibrillation and heart failure, it is unlikely that digoxin would be prescribed. The use of digoxin therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation has decreased as alternative therapeutic approaches with greater efficacy and reduced toxic effects have been recognized. Nondihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers slow the ventricular response at rest and during exertion. Digoxin is sometimes added if these agents do not adequately control the heart rate at maximal doses. However, the vagotonic effect of digoxin is overcome by the adrenergic surge that occurs during exercise, and therefore, digoxin is of limited use in preventing uncontrolled heart rates during exercise. The use of digoxin for the treatment of heart failure has also decreased because of the rise of more effective and less toxic therapies, including angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, neprilysin–angiotensin-receptor inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. A trial conducted by the Digitalis Investigation Group did not show a benefit from digoxin with respect to mortality in patients with symptomatic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, and the trial results also suggested harm from digoxin when it was present at high levels in the blood.16

The administration of digoxin-binding antibody fragments (i.e., digoxin immune Fab) is not necessarily indicated for several nuisance consequences of digoxin toxicity, including xanthopsia (yellow vision), nausea, bradycardia, and confusion. Life-threatening consequences of digoxin toxicity include ventricular tachycardia, severe bradycardia, complete heart block, and shock. The administration of digoxin immune Fab, which binds to digoxin and clears the drug from tissues, is indicated for the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias and shock, as well as for the prevention of these events when hyperkalemia is present.

This patient had a blood potassium level of more than 5 mmol per liter, which is associated with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias or death. She was treated with digoxin immune Fab; the dose was calculated on the basis of the blood digoxin level and body weight with the use of a dosing nomogram for chronic toxicity. Adverse events associated with the administration of digoxin immune Fab include heart failure, hypokalemia, and hypersensitivity to ovine Fab epitopes; none of these events occurred in this patient.17

Dr. Simmons: Before the patient was discharged from the hospital, we performed a careful assessment of her home situation. We learned that some memory deficits had developed in the patient and that her daughters were concerned that she had not been managing her medicines well. Her daughters did not think that this was a suicide attempt, and once the patient's mental status had improved, information obtained during an interview did not suggest depression. However, a cognitive evaluation indicated that she had deficits in short-term memory and executive functioning. Warfarin and digoxin were discontinued, and apixaban was initiated for stroke prevention. Medicaid coverage was reinstated. The patient was discharged home. Adjustments have been made to the doses of diuretics for heart failure, but otherwise, her medical condition has been stable. During the 12 months after her hospital stay, she had 19 telephone calls and 11 scheduled or urgent office visits to primary care and cardiology but had no hospitalizations or emergency department visits.

Our experience with this patient highlights several of the well-studied health consequences of being uninsured. Avoidable causes of death occur disproportionately in patients who do not have health insurance. Patients who regain insurance after being previously uninsured start to use outpatient services more often (as this patient did). Studies suggest that there are mortality benefits from acquiring health insurance.18 For me, the particularly distressing component of this patient's story is that she had survived a complex cardiac operation and had undergone advanced cardiac procedures, including pacemaker placement, only to subsequently lose access to her regular health coverage. Routine visits for primary care before this admission might have resulted in conversations about her cognitive functioning and her ability to manage medicines on her own, as well as a review of essential medications and perhaps the discontinuation of higher-risk medications, such as digoxin.

Figure 2. Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram, obtained on admission, shows an underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation with ventricular-demand pacing at a rate of 60 beats per minute. When atrioventricular conduction is present, at a rate slightly higher than 60 beats per minute, there is evidence of a regularized ventricular response with a pattern of right bundle-branch block.

A Physician: What did this patient's initial electrocardiogram show?

Dr. Randall M. Zusman (Cardiology): I cared for this patient at the hospital. The electrocardiogram obtained on admission (Fig. 2) showed an underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation with ventricular-demand pacing at a rate of 60 beats per minute. When atrioventricular conduction was present, there was evidence of a regularized ventricular response that was consistent with an excess of digoxin, but the ST-segment changes were more consistent with the underlying conduction-system disease than with classic digoxin toxicity. After digoxin immune Fab was administered, the patient was less dependent on the pacemaker; the cardiac rhythm was more irregular and the delay in the conduction system was less marked. In this case, the diagnosis of digoxin toxicity was based on the clinical features of an electrolyte disorder, acute renal insufficiency, and the suspected inadvertent administration of an excess of digoxin rather than on the development of classic findings on electrocardiography.
