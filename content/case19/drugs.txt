## Drugs

Medications are a common cause of delirium, particularly in older adults. Although this patient was receiving warfarin, her international normalized ratio was almost always in the therapeutic range, indicating that she had adhered to the prescription and seemed to have taken the medication correctly. Although psychoactive drugs had not been prescribed in the patient, she took multiple medications - including anticoagulants, diuretics, and several cardiac medications - that increased her risk of adverse drug events. Withdrawal syndromes can cause delirium, but this patient did not drink alcohol or use medications, such as benzodiazepines, that are associated with withdrawal syndromes. However, it remains possible that a drug effect could have contributed to her delirium.
