## Electrolyte And Metabolic Disturbances

This patient's calcium level is not reported, but she had mild hyponatremia and her urinalysis was notable for the presence of ketones. On physical examination, she had dry mucous membranes and no leg edema or jugular venous distention. Taken together, these findings are suggestive of volume depletion. I suspect her hyponatremia was due to an inadequate effective arterial blood volume, leading to the ongoing release of antidiuretic hormone. The hyponatremia was not severe enough to fully explain her delirium, but it can be a marker of underlying volume depletion, which can contribute to delirium.

This patient's glucose level was normal. The thyrotropin level is not available, but she did not have symptoms that were suggestive of either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The combination of hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and global weakness can indicate adrenal insufficiency, a very uncommon cause of delirium that may also explain the nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. However, the absence of hypotension makes adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
