## Infection

Infection involving the central nervous system is a serious consideration in patients with delirium, especially those with an abnormal neurologic examination or with no more likely cause of the condition. It is reassuring that this patient's neurologic examination was unremarkable and that the history did not raise concerns about seizure activity. In addition, nonâ€“contrast-enhanced CT of the head revealed only prominent ventricles and nonspecific periventricular white-matter hypodensities.

Infections outside the central nervous system can also lead to delirium. Two common culprits, urinary tract infection and pneumonia, are unlikely in the absence of pyuria and of consolidation on chest radiography, respectively. Although this patient had no known sick contacts, she presented in the winter after she had had an upper respiratory infection. Tests for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were negative, but other influenza-like illnesses remain possible. More remotely acquired infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, are also possible in this patient who had emigrated from Uganda 19 years before admission. Weight loss is not reported, but she was described as being cachectic and she had a BMI of 18.7 (with values of <18.5 indicating underweight status).8 However, she had normally walked for 30 minutes daily, indicating that she was physically robust, so perhaps she was just a very thin person.
