** Colorectal Cancer **
Dr. Murphy: This patient had received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with widespread metastasis to the liver and lymph nodes. Historically, colorectal cancer has been uncommon among younger people, with a me- dian age at diagnosis of 67 years.4 Screening with colonoscopy has lowered the overall incidence of colorectal cancer.5 However, the incidence among younger people has increased at a pronounced rate. As compared with people born around 1950, among whom rates of colorectal cancer are the lowest, people born in 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer (predominantly cancer involving the left side of the colon) and more than 4 times the risk of rectal cancer.6 Data show that 11% of colon cancers and 18% of rectal cancers occur in patients 20 to 49 years of age and are considered to be young-onset cases.6,7
This patient had young-onset colorectal cancer, which encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases associated with unique molecular mech- anisms, clinical presentations, and prognoses. In a greater proportion of young-onset cases than of older-onset cases, the underlying cause is a known genetic syndrome, such as the Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. The risk of young-onset colorectal cancer is up to 4 times as high among people who have a family history of colorectal cancer, particularly in a first- degree relative, as among those who do not have a family history. This suggests that the disease is associated with complex trait genetics and epi- genetic modifiers of risk.7-10 However, in the ma- jority of young patients with colorectal cancer, the disease is sporadic. This can lead to a delay in diagnosis, since the index of suspicion is low.11
Sporadic cancers involving the left side of the colon in young patients represent a unique subset of the disease. Such cancers tend to be aggressive and poorly differentiated, often with signet-ring cell differentiation. In general, they are associ- ated with a poor prognosis.12,13 This patient’s cancer appears to be consistent with this entity.

** Colorectal Cancer and Pregnancy ** 
Historically, colorectal cancer in pregnancy has been rare, occurring in 1 in 13,000 pregnancies. However, the convergence of two trends — the increased incidence of young-onset colorectal cancer and the increase in delayed childbearing — may place more women at risk.15 Some symp- toms of pregnancy (e.g., anemia, bloating, and a change in bowel habits) overlap with symptoms of colorectal cancer, and thus the cancer diagno- sis can be delayed.16 However, in studies involving patients with colorectal cancer, survival did not differ significantly between pregnant women and age- and stage-matched controls; this find- ing suggests that poor outcomes are more likely to be related to the aggressive features of spo- radic, early-onset disease than to pregnancy.17,18
In the absence of a family history of colorectal cancer, this patient’s disease was likely to be sporadic and to have an aggressive natural his- tory, and indeed, she presented with a poorly differentiated tumor. The location of her tumor on the left side was consistent with most cases of sporadic, young-onset colon cancer. The can- cer was likely to have arisen from a different genetic pathway than colorectal cancers in older patients.
Dr. Sgroi: Dr. Clark, if this patient were to opt for chemotherapy, what would be your approach to her treatment?

Dr. Jeffrey W. Clark: Data on the treatment of pregnant patients with metastatic colorectal can- cer are limited. Case reports suggest that FOLFOX (f luorouracil, leucovorin [folinic acid], and oxali- platin) chemotherapy can be administered safely until the fetus is sufficiently mature to deliver (gestational age, ≥33 weeks).16,19 However, there is very little information on long-term outcomes among the children. In this case, the baby was delivered successfully before the patient had de- cided whether to undergo chemotherapy.
This patient’s tumor was located on the left side, in the sigmoid colon, and was poorly dif- ferentiated; these features suggest an aggressive phenotype. Because she had numerous meta-static lesions on both lobes of the liver and had metastasis to lymph nodes, her tumor was not amenable to surgical resection and therefore was not curable. If the patient were to choose to undergo treatment, we would recommend initial FOLFOX chemotherapy, with the plan to add an anti–epidermal growth factor receptor agent such as cetuximab or panitumumab if she were to have a response to the initial cycles of treatment. This
strategy is based on the fact that she had primary cancer involving the left side of the colon without RAS or BRAF mutations.20-22 Small studies showed that FOLFOX chemotherapy was associ- ated with an acceptable side-effect profile in patients with the same degree of liver dysfunction that was seen in this patient.23,24 Given the hepato- biliary clearance of irinotecan, the administration of FOLFIRI (f luorouracil, leucovorin, and irino- tecan) or FOLFOXIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) chemotherapy would be contraindicated in this patient because of the clinically significant abnormal results of liver- function tests.
In considering possible later treatment approaches if the patient’s cancer were to progress after standard chemotherapy, a couple of addi- tional points about the biology of her tumor are worth mentioning. Despite her young age, her tumor had microsatellite stability, as indicated by the preserved nuclear expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in tumor cells. This means that she would not be a candidate for checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, which was recently approved for use in patients whose tu- mors have microsatellite instability.25,26 In addi- tion, her tumor had HER2 amplification on fluo- rescence in situ hybridization, a finding that is seen in approximately 4 to 5% of colorectal can- cers.27,28 Tumors with HER2 amplification have had a response to a combination of trastuzumab (a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2) and lapatinib (an inhibitor of HER2 kinase activity) and to a combination of trastuzumab and per- tuzumab (a monoclonal antibody that inhibits HER2 kinase activity in a different way) in clini- cal trials.29-31
The patient and her family were left with a very difficult decision. Her clinical status was deteriorating and she had a progressive decrease in liver function, and thus the need for a deci- sion about therapy was urgent. She had recently given birth and had a desire to spend time with her newborn, and she was ambivalent about chemotherapy. On the basis of these considera- tions, a palliative care approach without specific treatment would be reasonable but would result in a very limited life expectancy. In contrast, several features of her case would support the administration of chemotherapy. First, she was young and had a strong desire to be with her baby as long as possible. Second, she had not previ- ously undergone chemotherapy, so her chances of having a response to initial treatment were increased. Finally, she did not have any abnor- malities in organ function that would prohibit treatment.
The options of chemotherapy and supportive care were discussed in a family meeting that involved several family members and multiple members of the health care team. The patient opted to not start chemotherapy and to see how she did clinically before reconsidering. Unfortu- nately, her clinical status deteriorated rapidly, and after delivery of the baby, she was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU), where her condition further deteriorated over a period of 72 hours. Several days after the family meet- ing, the patient and her husband made the deci- sion to decline treatment with chemotherapy and to proceed with comfort measures only. The pa- tient saw her baby only once and died 5 days later under in-hospital hospice care, with her husband and brother at her side.
