Dr. Kristen M. Basnet: On histopathological exami- nation of sections of the colon-biopsy specimen, fragments of colonic mucosa were largely re- placed by a malignant cellular proliferation that was composed of large, atypical cells with prom- inent nucleoli, brisk mitotic activity, and areas suggestive of possible gland formation; these findings are consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining revealed preserved nuclear expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 in the tumor cells, findings that indicate the presence of microsatel- lite stability and thus rule out the Lynch syndrome (Fig. 2).
We also had the opportunity to review the liver-biopsy specimen that was obtained at the second hospital. On histopathological examina- tion of sections of the liver-biopsy specimen, multiple liver cores were heavily involved by a malignant gland-forming proliferation and were surrounded by fibrosis and abundant necrosis; these findings are consistent with moderately dif- ferentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. Immuno- histochemical staining revealed that the tumor
cells were positive for CK7, CK20, CDX2, and SMAD4 (retained), markers that are highly sug- gestive of colon cancer. The cells were negative for TTF1, PAX8, arginase-1, and GATA3, and these results effectively rule out cancer with a site of origin outside the gastrointestinal tract, such as lung or gynecologic cancer (Fig. 2).
