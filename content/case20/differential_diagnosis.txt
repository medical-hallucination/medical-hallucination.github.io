## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Chana A. Sacks: This 64-year-old man presented with a systemic inflammatory process with testicular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and possible pulmonary involvement. There are many potentially important elements of the history (including the pulmonary tuberculosis and HBV infection, the chronic cough, and the family history and emigration from China) and of the laboratory test results (including the fluctuating peripheral eosinophilia and elevated levels of inflammatory markers in the blood).

To build a differential diagnosis for this patient with multisystem organ involvement, I will choose a prominent feature of the case to use as an anchor. Although there are several possibilities, such as the myalgias that were severe enough to impair walking and the stabbing chest pain that was unrelated to exertion, these features and others would lead to a prohibitively broad list of possible diagnoses. Therefore, I will anchor on features that are central to this case and have a manageable differential diagnosis: testicular pain and swelling.

The differential diagnosis for testicular pain can be grouped according to three main causes: mechanical, infectious, and vascular. Certain mechanical causes of testicular pain, such as torsion of the testicle or a mass lesion, have been ruled out on the basis of imaging studies. Also, the patient did not report any testicular trauma. Of note, mechanical causes, other than perhaps a malignant mass,1 would not be manifested by a systemic illness of the extent seen in this case.
