## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Chana A. Sacks: This 64-year-old man presented with a systemic inflammatory process involving testicular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, renal, and possible pulmonary systems. Key elements of his history include prior pulmonary tuberculosis, HBV infection, chronic cough, family history, and emigration from China, as well as laboratory findings like fluctuating peripheral eosinophilia and elevated inflammatory markers.

To construct a differential diagnosis for a patient with multisystem organ involvement, I focus on a prominent feature to use as an anchor. While several possibilities exist (such as myalgias severe enough to impair walking and non-exertional stabbing chest pain), these would result in too broad a differential. Thus, I focus on features central to this case with a more manageable differential: testicular pain and swelling.

The differential diagnosis for testicular pain generally falls into three categories: mechanical, infectious, and vascular. Mechanical causes such as testicular torsion or a mass lesion have been ruled out based on imaging studies. Additionally, the patient did not report any testicular trauma. Importantly, mechanical causes, aside from a malignant mass, would not usually manifest as a systemic illness of the severity observed in this case.
