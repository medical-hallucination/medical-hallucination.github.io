## Infection

A thorough evaluation ruled out most potential infectious causes of this patient's syndrome. The most common causes of epididymo-orchitis are sexually transmitted infections (including gonorrhea and chlamydia) in younger populations and infections with *Escherichia coli* and other colonic bacteria that can be transmitted through anal intercourse or as a result of ascending urethritis, especially in older populations with benign prostatic hypertrophy.2 In this case, nucleic acid amplification tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia DNA were negative, a urinalysis revealed no white cells, and a urine culture had no growth, and thus these diagnoses would be unlikely.

Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection that is acquired through contact with infected animals or food products; 2 to 20% of cases of brucellosis in men result in epididymitis, orchitis, or testicular abscesses.3 However, this patient had no relevant exposures. Furthermore, in one case series, blood cultures were positive in 69% of patients who had brucellosis with testicular symptoms,4 and blood cultures were negative in this patient, as were tests for brucella-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; these findings effectively rule out this diagnosis. Mumps is an important consideration in this patient, especially since his vaccination status is unknown. However, he had no swelling of the parotid gland, which usually precedes orchitis. Also, he had no known exposures, and a test for mumps-specific IgM antibodies was negative.

Tuberculosis is a particularly important consideration in this patient, since he had a known previous infection and presented with a systemic illness. Tuberculosis can affect the testicle, resulting in swelling that can be either painful or painless.5,6 Evaluation for reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis had so far been unrevealing. Although the testicle may seem to be an unlikely primary site of extrapulmonary infection, a definitive declaration that this (or nearly any) syndrome could not be tuberculosis would make a clinician pause. Ultimately, a biopsy of the testicle, with a mycobacterial smear, culture, and pathological examination of the biopsy specimen, would be necessary to evaluate this possibility.
