## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Krzysztof Glomski: Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the temporal-artery biopsy specimen showed a dense inflammatory infiltrate in the adventitia of the arterial wall and additional scattered inflammatory cells in the vascular media and intima. Verhoeffâ€“van Gieson staining showed fragmentation and disruption of elastic fibers in the vascular intima, and immunohistochemical staining for CD3 and CD163 highlighted lymphocytes and histiocytes, respectively, in the inflammatory infiltrate. The presence of a vascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and elastic-fiber disruption supported a diagnosis of active arteritis. In a medium-to-large vessel such as the temporal artery, diagnostic considerations include giant-cell arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and an ANCA-associated vasculitis; the latter two entities were favored since the inflammatory infiltrate was centered in the adventitia rather than the media. An absence of giant cells (as in this case) does not rule out a diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis.

In addition to the temporal-artery biopsy, an epididymal biopsy was performed. Histologic examination revealed prominent inflammation surrounding small arteries in fibrovascular connective tissue between unremarkable epididymal tubules. At higher magnification, a full-thickness necrotizing vasculitis was visible, with fibrin deposition and luminal obliteration by an inflammatory infiltrate that was composed of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Immunohistochemical staining for CD3 and CD163 highlighted lymphocytes and histiocytes in the inflammatory infiltrate. Examination of biopsy specimens of testicular tissue, obtained during the same procedure, also revealed necrotizing vasculitis of small-to-medium arteries of the testis. Taken together, these histologic findings strongly supported a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa.
