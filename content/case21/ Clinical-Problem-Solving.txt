# A Breathtaking Discovery

A 76-year-old man presented during the summer of 2021 with a 1-month history of progressively worsening exertional dyspnea and fatigue. He had previously been able to walk across a golf course without discomfort but now needed a golf cart, and he became breathless during light activities such as getting dressed. He reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, chest discomfort, orthopnea, swelling of the arms or legs, weight gain, or bloody stools. He also had a new onset of headaches on awakening that were worse when he was in the supine position and abated with the use of aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine. Subacute dyspnea on exertion can be caused by cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, as well as by neuromuscular disorders, anemia, metabolic disturbances, and physical deconditioning. Characterizing the quality, triggers, and tempo of dyspnea can help to determine its cause. The subacute onset of air hunger is unlikely to represent new obstructive lung disease, but it could be a symptom of a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases including coronary atherosclerosis, arrhythmia, valvulopathy, heart failure, and pericardial effusion, as well as diseases of the alveoli, lung parenchyma, and pulmonary vasculature. New morning headaches in a patient older than 50 years of age that are worse when the patient is in the supine position merit neuroimaging to rule out a space-occupying lesion; however, headache in association with dyspnea might reflect multifocal infection or hypoxia in the context of cardiac or pulmonary disease. The patient's medical history included anal squamous-cell carcinoma that had been treated 12 years earlier with fluorouracil and mitomycin C, radiation therapy, and abdominoperineal resection. He subsequently had three episodes of genital cellulitis and began suppressive therapy with daily amoxicillin, which he had been taking for the past 10 years without recurrences. He also had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which he used a continuous positive airway pressure device on a regular basis. In addition to amoxicillin, his medications included daily aspirin, fexofenadine, gabapentin, losartan, simvastatin, and tamsulosin, as well as a daily multivitamin. He was a retired attorney who lived in the greater Boston area with his wife. He had never smoked cigarettes and had no pets. He had consumed at least 6 ounces of liquor daily for many years. Rectal cancer can metastasize to the lung and brain, and fatigue and headache could be symptoms of recurrent or new cancer. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are risk factors for coronary artery disease, and myocardial ischemia frequently manifests as exertional dyspnea. Chronic heavy alcohol use can also confer a predisposition to various conditions associated with dyspnea, such as atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy, cirrhosis, and anemia. The long-term use of antibiotic agents may also have increased this patient's risk of pulmonary infection from multidrug-resistant organisms. The patient's oral temperature was 37.1°C, the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was breathing through pursed lips. The mucous membranes were moist, and skin turgor was normal. There was normal air movement with no use of accessory muscles of ventilation. Breath sounds and heart sounds were normal. There was no jugular venous distention or edema in the legs. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without palpable hepatosplenomegaly. He had no rash, clubbing of the fingers, bruising, or cyanosis. No neck stiffness, cranial nerve dysfunction, or dysmetria were present, and the muscle strength was normal. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, an incomplete right bundle-branch block, and no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Pursed-lip breathing is a voluntary breathing pattern that prolongs expiration and provides a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure. It is commonly observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in which it serves to mitigate dynamic hyperinflation. The absence of wheezes and rhonchi does not rule out airway obstruction, which could be better assessed with the use of pulmonary-function testing. An incomplete right bundle-branch block is a nonspecific finding that can occur in the presence or absence of structural heart disease. Despite the patient's normal vital signs and reassuring physical examination, it would be prudent to rule out life-threatening causes of dyspnea, including non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and venous thromboembolism. The white-cell count was 4660 per cubic millimeter, the hemoglobin level 10.9 g per deciliter, the mean corpuscular volume 93.6 fl, and the platelet count 106,000 per microliter; all these variables had been within normal limits 1 year earlier. The alanine aminotransferase level was 46 IU per liter (normal range, 10 to 50), the aspartate aminotransferase level 43 IU per liter (normal range, 10 to 50), and the total bilirubin level 1.2 mg per deciliter (20.5 μmol per liter; normal range, 0.0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0.0 to 17.1 μmol per liter]); the levels of alkaline phosphatase and albumin were normal. The troponin T level (as assessed by the high-sensitivity test) in each of two serial blood samples obtained 3 hours apart was 25 ng per liter (normal range, 0 to 14), and the N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide level was 76 pg per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 1800). The international normalized ratio was 1.2 (normal range, 0.9 to 1.1), the partial-thromboplastin time 40.0 seconds (normal range, 24.1 to 33.6), and the D- dimer level 1693 ng per milliliter (normal range, 0 to 500). The ferritin level was 1485 μg per liter (normal range, 30 to 400), and the transferrin saturation 10% (normal range, 20 to 40). The thyrotropin and cobalamin levels were normal, as were the venous pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. A polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was negative.

Computed tomography (CT) of the head was normal. CT of the abdomen and pelvis were notable for mild splenomegaly and liver abnormalities including an irregular nodular contour, widening of the fissures, and caudate hypertrophy (Fig. 1). CT angiography of the chest showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and no infiltrates or masses. The mildly elevated, stable serum troponin level indicates myocardial injury but is inconsistent with a type 1 (atherothrombotic) myocardial infarction. Anemia causes a decrease in oxygen delivery to the heart and leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output, which can cause dyspnea and result in supply–demand mismatch sufficient to cause myocardial ischemia, especially if there is preexisting obstructive coronary artery disease.

The liver findings on CT are most consistent with cirrhosis; splenomegaly could be a sign of portal hypertension or a separate infectious, malignant, or autoimmune process. This patient has no evidence of hepatic synthetic dysfunction or decompensated cirrhosis that could cause dyspnea resulting from pulmonary hypertension associated with portal hypertension or from hepatopulmonary syndrome. Cirrhosis could lead to anemia and thrombocytopenia through splenic sequestration, gastrointestinal blood loss, anemia of chronic disease, or spur-cell hemolytic anemia. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate left atrial enlargement, mild right atrial enlargement, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation with no abnormalities in regional wall motion. The estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (normal range, 15 to 30), and the estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 65%. A myocardial perfusion single-photonemission CT scan with technetium-99m–labeled tetrofosmin showed no regional perfusion deficits after the subsequent administration of regadenoson. There is echocardiographic evidence of structural remodeling that is most likely associated with chronic hypertension and alcohol use, but no clinical signs of heart failure are present. Although diastolic dysfunction may be contributing to the dyspnea, no cardiopulmonary pathologic condition that explains this patient's exertional dyspnea and fatigue has been identified. Anemia is the most likely explanation. Normocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia can be caused by destruction or consumption of erythrocytes and platelets, splenic sequestration, and bone marrow suppression, infiltration, and failure. Autoimmune disorders, hemolytic anemia, infections, and hematologic cancers, are most likely to manifest subacutely. The reticulocyte count was 3.6%, which corresponded to a reticulocyte production index (a calculated value that corrects the reticulocyte count for the degree of anemia and corresponding increase in erythrocyte maturation time) of 1.8 (normal value, >2.0). A peripheral-blood smear showed no blasts or schistocytes. The lactate dehydrogenase level was 574 IU per liter (normal range, 135 to 225), and haptoglobin was undetectable. Direct and indirect antiglobulin tests were negative. Urinalysis showed 1+ urobilinogen and no hematuria. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 111 mm per hour (normal value, <15), the C-reactive protein level 164 mg per liter (normal value, <5.0), and the fibrinogen level 854 mg per deciliter (normal range, 227 to 481). Antinuclear antibodies were not detected. The undetectable haptoglobin level, the elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, and the negative antiglobulin tests are consistent with nonimmune hemolytic anemia. Causes of subacute nonimmune hemolytic anemia include infections, hematologic cancers, thrombotic microangiopathies, exposure to oxidant drugs, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In the absence of schistocytes and hemoglobinuria, an infection is the most likely cause of the nonimmune hemolytic anemia. Several organisms can cause lysis of erythrocytes, including Babesia microti or other babesia species, plasmodium species (which cause malaria), and (rarely) Bartonella bacilliformis. Of these, only *B. microti* is commonly encountered in the northeastern United States. Babesiosis classically manifests with fever, but in patients with cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction, a febrile response to systemic infections may not occur.

On hospital day 4, the hemoglobin level had decreased to 9.0 g per deciliter, the alanine aminotransferase level had increased to 63 IU per liter, and the aspartate aminotransferase level had increased to 57 IU per liter. Examination of a thin blood smear for parasites revealed intraerythrocytic ring-form trophozoites, with 2.1% parasitemia (Fig. 2). PCR testing for *B. microti* was positive. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Borrelia burgdorferi IgM and IgG were negative, as was a combined PCR test for Anaplasma phagocytophilum and ehrlichia species. The patient did not recall a recent tick bite, but there was extensive scrub vegetation in his backyard and at the golf course he frequented.

Azithromycin and atovaquone were administered for 10 days. Examination of a repeat thin blood smear 2 weeks later showed no parasites. Ten weeks later, the hemoglobin level and platelet count had normalized, and the dyspnea had resolved.

## Commentary

In 2019, a total of 2420 cases of babesiosis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 93.1% of which occurred in the Northeast region of the United States, with most of the remaining 6.9% of cases scattered across the South Atlantic and upper Midwest regions.1 Most infections occur between May and September and are caused by the protozoan *B. microti*, an obligate parasite of human erythrocytes that is transmitted to humans through the bite of the Ixodes scapularis tick, with an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks.2 As a result of the warming of the North American climate, the range of I. scapularis is extending northward beyond the Canadian border, and temperatures are expected to remain suitable for tick activity during longer periods of the year; increasing suburban sprawl in rural areas also increases scrub habitat and boosts tick populations.3,4 A small number of cases of babesiosis have been caused by transfusion of blood products, solid-organ transplantation, and transplacental transmission. Since 2019, the Food and Drug Administration has required nucleic acid testing for *B. microti* or the use of pathogen-reduction technology for blood donations collected in 14 states and the District of Columbia, locations in which *B. microti* infection is endemic.

Babesiosis should be suspected in any patient who is living in, or has recently visited, an area where the condition is endemic and is having fever, sweats, chills, headache, or fatigue with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels, or in patients in whom other infections transmitted by I. scapularis (such as Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, Borrelia miyamotoi infection, and Powassan virus infection) have been diagnosed. Left untreated, babesiosis can range in severity from asymptomatic disease (observed in approximately 20% of healthy adults) to severe illness that is complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.5 Severe disease is most common among immunocompromised patients and older adults. Although illness generally lasts 1 to 2 weeks, fatigue may last for several months, and asymptomatic parasitemia may persist for more than a year without treatment.6 Diagnosis of tickborne illness requires a high index of clinical suspicion and familiarity with local epidemiologic factors because many patients will not recall a tick bite. It is important for clinicians to know the symptoms and signs of tickborne diseases, such as erythema migrans, the rash associated with Lyme disease; the distinctive cutaneous findings described in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Southern tick–associated rash illness; the ulcero-glandular and pneumonic presentations of tularemia; and the relapsing fever associated with B. miyamotoi disease.

On microscopic examination of a thin blood smear through an oil-immersion lens with Wright–Giemsa staining, *B. microti* trophozoites appear as round, oval, or pear-shaped ring forms within erythrocytes that are occasionally arranged in pathognomonic tetrads. The sensitivity of microscopy has been reported to range from 59 to 84%, as compared with 95% for PCR testing.7,8 Detection may be enhanced by regular education of laboratory personnel who process blood smears in areas in which babesiosis is endemic. A PCR test can be used to establish a diagnosis in cases of low-level parasitemia that is undetectable on a blood smear, when personnel with expertise in microscopy are unavailable, or when species-level identification is desired. Between 6% and 23% of patients with babesiosis are reportedly coinfected with *B. burgdorferi*, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and approximately 2 to 19% of patients with Lyme disease are infected with *B. microti*, although there is marked variation in the incidence of these coinfections, depending on several factors, including local rates of Lyme disease and babesiosis and diagnostic methods.9 Thus, testing for Lyme disease is typically recommended in patients with babesiosis, as is a careful skin examination for erythema migrans. In patients who do not respond to treatment for babesiosis, clinicians may also consider evaluating for A. phagocytophilum by PCR testing because that bacterium is also carried by *I. scapularis*; however, anaplasmosis is a less common coinfection than Lyme disease.9 The preferred initial treatment regimen for babesiosis, regardless of disease severity, is atovaquone and azithromycin for 7 to 10 days, with longer treatment courses reserved for patients who are highly immunocompromised or who have refractory disease.10 Clindamycin and quinine sulfate is an alternative treatment regimen; in an unblinded, randomized trial involving 58 immunocompetent patients with babesiosis, this regimen showed efficacy that was similar to that of atovaquone and azithromycin but resulted in a higher incidence of adverse effects.11 Exchange transfusion is reserved for patients with greater than 10% parasitemia, severe hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or respiratory, renal, or hepatic failure.10 Treatment response can be monitored by the evaluation of serial peripheral-blood smears in immunocompromised patients, but resolution of parasitemia need not be confirmed in immunocompetent patients whose symptoms have resolved; repeat PCR testing should be reserved for patients with persistent symptoms whose blood smears no longer show *B. microti*.

10 Unlike most tickborne parasites, *B. microti* is not susceptible to doxycycline, and the use of doxycycline as prophylaxis after a tick bite does not prevent babesiosis. Primary care clinicians practicing in areas in which babesiosis is endemic should provide patients with anticipatory guidance on the prevention of tick bites, such as recommending the use of protective clothing and insect repellents and the performance of regular skin checks after outdoor activity.

The clinical team initially focused on identifying common and life-threatening cardiovascular and pulmonary causes of dyspnea, given the patient's age and history of hyperlipidemia and cancer. Despite the presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly at presentation, suspicion of babesiosis was raised only after the identification of hemolysis and elevated aminotransferase levels on hospital day 4, after flowlimiting coronary artery disease had been ruled out. Yet, when the case is reframed as a summertime case of a New England golfer with new anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly, the diagnosis of babesiosis becomes much less challenging.

The identification of the correct diagnosis required overcoming multiple cognitive biases.12 The incidental finding of radiologic evidence of liver fibrosis provided a plausible explanation for the findings of anemia and thrombocytopenia, on which the clinical team initially anchored. This is an example of "search satisficing" (i.e., ceasing to look for alternative explanations once the first plausible solution is found).13 In addition, consideration of an infectious cause of anemia required looking beyond the representativeness heuristic - the tendency to look for classic presentations of disease rather than atypical variations. Fever is present in 89% of documented cases of babesiosis,5 but it may be absent in infected hosts with immune dysfunc-tion, such as this patient with cirrhosis.14 These biases can be overcome with a "diagnostic timeout," a process during which a clinical team identifies consistencies and inconsistencies between known data and a working diagnosis, identifies alternative diagnoses and data gaps, and acknowledges and acts on diagnostic uncertainty.15 The combination of this patient's highly suggestive laboratory tests and the recognition of local tickborne diseases ultimately led to the identification of babesiosis as an uncommon cause of a common condition, dyspnea.
