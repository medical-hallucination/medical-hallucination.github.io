Buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist) can precipitate withdrawal if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several hours before the first dose and has not begun to have withdrawal symptoms. Like naltrexone, buprenorphine can be prescribed in any clinical setting, although to prescribe buprenorphine in an outpatient setting, a waiver must be obtained from the Drug Enforcement Agency after completion of additional training (8 hours for physicians and 24 hours for nurse practitioners and physician assistants). Buprenorphine is typically combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal formulation to reduce the potential for injection or diversion. A long-acting injectable buprenorphine formulation was approved by the FDA in 2018.

This patient had some experience with use of buprenorphine that had been obtained by illicit means. I would ask the patient whether she had any withdrawal symptoms, sedation, or dysphoria when she took buprenorphine; whether it was helpful in reducing her oxycodone use; and how well she functioned while she took it. If buprenorphine had worked well for her, then I would ask why she requested naltrexone rather than buprenorphine during her primary care visit. As agonist treatments, buprenorphine and methadone are often stigmatized as "trading one drug for another." This stigma undermines the clear evidence from multiple clinical trials that buprenorphine and methadone therapies can break the addiction cycle of compulsive use.
