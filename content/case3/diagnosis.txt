Dr. Alexander Y. Walley: I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. This 29-year-old woman presented to her primary care clinic after she had symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal syndrome, which had spontaneously resolved in less than 1 day. At the end of the visit, she requested injectable intramuscular naltrexone, and she later described a history that fulfilled criteria for severe opioid use disorder (Table 1). The patient reportedly used approximately $100 worth of nonprescribed oxycodone per day and thus was at high risk for use of heroin and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, which are more potent, widely accessible, and less expensive. However, according to the history and results of urine toxicology screening, her opioid use disorder was limited to use of illicit oxycodone. Although the patient requested naltrexone treatment, she did not complete the urine toxicology screening or return to the clinic for 6 months. I suspect that the patient had some ambivalence about treatment, which is common among patients with substance use disorder. Despite any ambivalence, the high mortality associated with opioid use disorder makes it imperative to find an effective treatment for this patient.
