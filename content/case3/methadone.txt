In contrast with naltrexone, methadone (a full opioid agonist) is not associated with a risk of precipitated withdrawal, so abstinence before the initiation of methadone treatment is not necessary. However, because methadone has a relatively long and unpredictable half-life, the treatment must be initiated carefully. An initial low dose and slow approach helps to ensure that the patient is not oversedated during the first several weeks. As a treatment for pain, methadone can be prescribed and dispensed in a manner similar to any other opioid pain medication, but as a treatment for opioid use disorder, methadone can be administered to patients outside the hospital only through an opioid treatment program that is licensed and regulated at the federal and state levels.

If this patient were hospitalized for a reason other than addiction, she could be treated with methadone for opioid withdrawal, and if on discharge from the hospital she were linked to an opioid treatment program, she could be treated with methadone for opioid use disorder. Regulations for opioid treatment programs require patients to receive methadone daily at the clinic and to undergo weekly counseling, random toxicology testing, and medical and psychiatric assessment. Patients may earn "take home" doses after 60 days of documented abstinence and with perfect attendance of dosing and counseling appointments. Methadone treatment through an opioid treatment program is one potential option for this patient to consider.
