This patient indicated a preference for naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Oral naltrexone is available in generic form and is administered once daily as a tablet. However, meta-analyses have shown that oral naltrexone is no more effective than placebo in lowering the rate of opioid use or increasing the rate of retention in treatment. Injectable intramuscular naltrexone is administered every 28 days by a health care provider and is effective in reducing opioid cravings and illicit opioid use. Prescribing naltrexone does not require special training or licensing, although prescribing injectable intramuscular naltrexone often requires prior authorization from an insurance company or collaboration with a specialty pharmacy.

The initiation of either injectable or oral naltrexone treatment precipitates withdrawal symptoms if the patient has not abstained from opioid use for several days before initiation. Of course, abstinence also causes withdrawal symptoms, which are a potent driver of continued substance use. Achieving the abstinence that is necessary to initiate naltrexone therapy is a major challenge; this explains the patient's unsuccessful attempts at treatment with naltrexone. If she again attempts to undergo treatment with naltrexone, how can she and her provider work together to increase the likelihood that she will continue to take the medication? Before the initiation of naltrexone treatment, the patient's withdrawal symptoms should be treated either in an inpatient detoxification unit or at home on an outpatient basis, with comfort medications, social support, and close follow-up.
