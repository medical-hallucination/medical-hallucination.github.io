This patient has at least two promising prognostic characteristics. First, she is seeking treatment and has sought treatment in the past. It is normal for patients with substance use disorder to have multiple episodes of attempted treatment and relapse, but over time, the relapse periods should shorten and the remission periods should lengthen. Second, she abstained from drug use for years after the birth of her daughter, which is a sign that she may be able to abstain in the future.

The patient is receiving care from primary care and mental health care providers. Who would best treat her opioid use disorder? Does she need specialty treatment? If she and her providers decide that methadone is the best option, then she will need to enroll in an opioid treatment program, which is typically separate from primary care and mental health care. If they choose naltrexone or buprenorphine, either treatment can be delivered effectively in the primary care or community mental health care setting. The patient should receive care in the setting in which she is least likely to discontinue treatment, thus minimizing her risk of relapse and overdose.
