This case shows several ways in which the care of patients with opioid use disorder can be improved. During the patient's previous encounters with the health care system, there were missed opportunities to discuss and diagnose her opioid use disorder. Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has found insufficient evidence to support universal screening for substance use disorder, screening was warranted in this patient on the basis of her history, which included multiple risk factors for substance use disorder, such as tobacco use disorder, underlying mood disorder, fatigue and daytime drowsiness, and motor vehicle accidents. Although overdose has replaced motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, this case reminds us that a substantial proportion of motor vehicle crashes involve the use of substances â€“ most commonly alcohol but increasingly other substances, such as marijuana and opioids. Effective screening can be accomplished with one question: "How many times in the past year have you used an illegal drug or used a prescription medication for nonmedical reasons?" In this patient, the answer to this question, followed by further exploration of the frequency of her substance use and the quantity that she used each time as well as exploration of the consequences of her use, could have allowed her providers to address her substance use disorder at an earlier stage. When the patient requested medication for opioid use disorder, she most likely had already met criteria for this diagnosis. However, it is useful to review the diagnostic criteria with the patient to confirm the diagnosis and its severity (Table 1). The criteria will continue to be useful for monitoring this patient. As her condition improves, the number of criteria she meets will decrease, indicating reduced severity.
