Adherence to treatment is a major challenge for patients who receive any of these three medications. It is worth noting that patients who take methadone may have longer retention in treatment than those who take buprenorphine, and patients who take buprenorphine have longer retention than those who take naltrexone. In the first 4 weeks after discontinuation of these medications, there is a surge in overdose mortality, which is driven by the high likelihood of relapse coupled with reduced tolerance. Before the initiation of naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine treatment in this patient, it would be crucial to explain to her that she is at very high risk for relapse and overdose if she discontinues the medication.

Regardless of the treatment that is chosen, this patient will need a strategy to reduce the risk of overdose in the event of relapse. Key elements of an overdose risk-reduction plan include use of opioids in the presence of others who are equipped with naloxone and can respond if overdose occurs; avoidance of additional sedative substances, such as benzodiazepines and alcohol; and administration of the opioid at the lowest possible dose and slowly to test its potency. In accordance with guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services, a naloxone rescue kit should be prescribed to this patient so that she can be prepared to respond to any overdose that she witnesses and can ensure that naloxone is available to anyone who is with her if she relapses.
