First-line treatment for this patient would be one of the three medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of opioid use disorder: naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine. These medications lead to longer retention in treatment and decreased opioid use and opioid cravings. In a meta-analysis, methadone and buprenorphine were strongly associated with decreased rates of overdose and death from any cause. In choosing the best medication for this patient, it would be necessary to have an understanding of not only the treatment-program requirements for each medication but also the patientâ€™s preferences and previous experience with these medications.
