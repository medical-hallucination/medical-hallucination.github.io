Although this patient has a history of clinically significant cardiac disease, multifocal pneumonia and ARDS are the likely causes of his hypoxemic respiratory failure. The diagnosis of ARDS is made if a patient has sudden onset (or progression) of symptoms within 1 week after a known clinical insult, bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging, respiratory failure that is not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload, and moderate-to-severe impairment of oxygenation; this patient met all four criteria. ARDS can be precipitated by various triggers, including infection, aspiration, trauma, transfusion-related lung injury, the use of illicit drugs, or acute pancreatitis. This patient had reported cough and fever in the week preceding the onset of respiratory failure, raising concern for viral or bacterial pneumonia. Although he presented while there was still substantial influenza activity in the area, his syndrome progressed rapidly while he was receiving oseltamivir. Because of the patient's presentation during the initial increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in Massachusetts and the possibility of his occupational exposure to asymptomatic but infected patients, Covid-19 is the leading diagnosis in this case. The patient's age, male sex, and history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension all increase his risk of having a severe form of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
