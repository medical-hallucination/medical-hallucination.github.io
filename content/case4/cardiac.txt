This patient had an elevated troponin T level suggestive of myocardial injury, which is common among critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a retrospective single-center cohort study involving 416 hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, cardiac injury, defined by a troponin T level above the 99th percentile (upper limit of the reference range), was present in 19.7% of the patients. This patient's ST-segment elevations in leads I and aVL arouse concern about an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the lateral wall. However, the presence of subtle PR-segment deflections on the electrocardiogram, the finding of biventricular systolic dysfunction, and the high levels of inflammatory markers may suggest myopericarditis. The fact that the left ventricle was not dilated suggests that the cardiomyopathic process is most likely acute.

Other possible causes of this patient's findings on electrocardiography include ischemia (due to either sudden rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in an epicardial coronary vessel or a supplyâ€“demand mismatch resulting from hypoxemia and sepsis), cytokine-mediated myocardial injury in the context of a hyperinflammatory state, or stress-induced cardiomyopathy (whereby an emotional or physical stressor produces transient ventricular systolic dysfunction). It is important to rule out all other causes of myocardial dysfunction before making a diagnosis of stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Of note, this patient's normal central venous oxygen saturation and low central venous pressure suggest that the development of hypotension is probably due to the use of sedative and paralytic medications and to distributive shock in the context of infection, rather than a cardiogenic cause. To determine the next steps in the evaluation of this patient, urgent decision making about the need for coronary angiography is warranted, with attention given to the possible infectious risks associated with performing this procedure in a patient who most likely has SARS-CoV-2 infection.
