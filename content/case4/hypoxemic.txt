The differential diagnosis of this patient's pulmonary findings includes cardiogenic pulmonary edema, multifocal pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Prosthetic-valve dysfunction and endocarditis can cause pulmonary edema, but there were no examination findings suggestive of prosthetic aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. Furthermore, the limited echocardiographic views that were available suggested that the prosthesis was functioning normally. Despite the presence of ventricular dysfunction and an elevated N-terminal proâ€“B-type natriuretic peptide level, cardiogenic pulmonary edema is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient, given the low central venous pressure and the absence of physical examination findings to support congestion.
