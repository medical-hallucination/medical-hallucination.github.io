Dr. Kazi: Several reported cases of possible myopericarditis among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been published. Some of these patients presented with localized ST-segment elevations on electrocardiography but were subsequently noted to have no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. One patient, a previously healthy 53-year-old woman who presented with a 1-week history of dyspnea and subjective fever, was noted to have diffuse ST-segment elevations, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and a small pericardial effusion, as well as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that were reportedly diagnostic of acute myopericarditis. In another patient, cardiac tamponade developed from a pericardial effusion that was attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although patients in whom myocardial injury develops also typically have moderate-to-severe lung involvement, cases with isolated cardiac involvement have also been reported. Most case reports have suggested that if a patient survives the initial infection, there is recovery of myocardial function in the subsequent weeks, although acute and severe cardiac deterioration after pulmonary recovery have been reported. Although we are still learning about the findings of myopericarditis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be observed on electrocardiography, other causes of myopericarditis and cardiac irritation are known to produce a range of changes on electrocardiography, including ST-segment elevations that can mimic a STEMI.

Given the constellation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is myopericarditis due to infection with SARS-CoV-2.
