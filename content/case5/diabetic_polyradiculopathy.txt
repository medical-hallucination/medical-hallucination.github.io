## Diabetic Polyradiculopathy

There are several disorders that cause or mimic subacute polyradiculopathy or polyradiculoneuropathy with potentially normal findings on imaging of the spine, as described in this patient. Among the most common of these disorders is diabetic thoracic polyradiculopathy, which is the pathophysiological equivalent of diabetic cervical or lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy. One quarter of cases of acute-to-subacute thoracic polyradiculopathy coincide with a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, which fits with this patient's newly discovered elevated blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. However, patients with diabetic polyradiculopathy typically have a prodrome of constitutional symptoms that include weight loss and malaise, as well as symptoms of autonomic failure, and such symptoms were not seen in this patient. In addition, the symptoms of diabetic radiculopathy are often bilateral but are usually asymmetric and limited to one segment (cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral). Overall, I think diabetic thoracic polyradiculopathy is unlikely in this case.
