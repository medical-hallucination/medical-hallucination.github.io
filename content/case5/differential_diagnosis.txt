## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Haatem M. Reda: The first step in evaluating a patient with a potential neurologic problem is to define the syndrome - that is, the neuroanatomical localization combined with a specific temporal profile. Over a 10-week period, this patient had back pain followed by weakness in muscles of the abdominal and thoracic walls, reduced truncal sensation with involvement of the genitals, multifocal areflexic weakness in the arms and legs, and probable urinary overflow incontinence. Localization of the process will allow us to develop an initial differential diagnosis that can then be logically narrowed.
