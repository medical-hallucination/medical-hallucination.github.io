## Discussion of Management

Dr. Nagagopal Venna: During the summer and fall months in New England, it is common to diagnose Lyme polyradiculitis or meningoradiculitis in patients presenting with subacute, multifocal, painful radiculitis. This syndrome typically affects the arms and legs asymmetrically and often includes cranial nerve palsies. However, this patient's symptoms mainly involved the trunk, with lesser involvement of the arms and legs, leading to diagnostic challenges. Initially, visceral causes of pain are often explored, and neurologic causes are considered only if paresthesias point to a neurological origin. In this case, examining skin sensation on the abdominal and chest walls and testing abdominal-wall muscle strength were crucial for the correct diagnosis. Lyme disease can show a preference for the thoracic nerve roots, although the reason remains unclear, possibly relating to the site of infection inoculation.

Following a confirmed diagnosis, the patient was treated with a 3-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone. Her diabetes management began with a sliding scale of insulin, followed by metformin. The notable absence of distal symmetric sensory peripheral neuropathy and the rapid onset of asymmetric polyradiculopathy with CSF pleocytosis made diabetic polyradiculopathy an unlikely diagnosis. Over four weeks, the patient's pain decreased. At her 4-month follow-up post-ceftriaxone treatment, her abdominal wall sensation and strength had improved, allowing for the contraction of the rectus abdominis muscles while standing, though she still struggled with sitting up from a supine position. The left foot weakness reduced, but there remained difficulty in walking on the heel.
