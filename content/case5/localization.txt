## Localization

This patient's initial symptom was pain between the shoulder blades, a least specific symptom which typically localizes somewhere in the peripheral nervous system. Injuries to spinal sensory nerve roots are known to cause back pain that radiates to the axilla or flank.

A crucial aspect of this patient's neuromuscular evaluation involved examining the abdominal-wall muscles, essential for trunk flexion and forceful exhalation, preventing abdominal contents from protruding. While the presence of Beevor's sign, deflection of the umbilicus away from a weak segment of the rectus abdominis muscle upon activation, was not assessed, the patient exhibited an inability to sit up from the supine position and suffered from abdominal distention due to diminished abdominal-wall muscle tone. The concurrent numbness she experienced rules out a myopathy, suggesting the weakness of the abdominal-wall muscles localizes to the lower thoracic or upper lumbar nerve roots.

The patient had difficulty taking a deep breath and coughing, potentially indicative of diaphragmatic weakness from dysfunction of the upper cervical cord or brain stem. However, she did not exhibit weakness on neck flexion or oropharyngeal dysphagia, and diaphragmatic excursion was normal upon examination. Another potential cause of her difficulty in breathing is the weakness of the external intercostal muscles, responsible for the expansion of the chest cavity during inspiration, and innervated by thoracic segmental nerve roots.

Considering the patient's sensory symptoms, reduced truncal sensation suggests dysfunction of the sensory tracts in the spinal cord, sensory nerve roots, dorsal-root ganglia, or segmental nerves. Her sensory loss displayed a bandlike or suspended distribution, characterized by superior and inferior boundaries. This suspended sensory level could be consistent with a small central cord lesion or syrinx with spinothalamic-tract fiber interruption in the ventral commissure. Central cord lesions can induce pain, and if sufficiently large, they may affect anterior horns, resulting in areflexic segmental weakness.

However, numerous features in this presentation argue against a central cord lesion. Central cord lesions typically manifest contiguous deficits, whereas this patient displayed noncontiguous numbness in the lower cervical, lower thoracic, and sacral segments, sparing the upper cervical and lower lumbar segments. Additionally, genital area numbness contradicts a central cord lesion, given that spinothalamic-tract fibers from the sacral segment are laterally positioned and usually remain unaffected. The patient's urinary incontinence would not typically occur with small central cord lesions or syringomyelia. She also did not display myelopathic signs, such as spastic paraparesis, hyperreflexia, or crossed sensory signs suggestive of a significant cord lesion.

A suspended sensory level could also emerge from spinal sensory nerve-root or ganglion dysfunction. Ganglionopathy can be ruled out due to the presence of weakness. Overall, her syndrome aligns most closely with a subacute polyradiculopathy or polyradiculoneuropathy, initially targeting mid and lower thoracic segments, then progressing to lower cervical, upper thoracic, lumbar, and sacral segments.
