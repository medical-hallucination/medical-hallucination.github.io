## Neurosarcoidosis

Neurosarcoidosis has a variety of manifestations, which can include thoracic polyradiculopathy. It tends to involve sensory nerve roots and ganglia but more commonly affects cranial nerve roots and the optic nerves. Patients often have systemic disease and abnormal findings on neuroimaging, features absent in this case. While neurosarcoidosis cannot be entirely ruled out, other possible causes for this patient's symptoms should be considered.
