## Neurosarcoidosis

Neurosarcoidosis has protean manifestations, which can include thoracic polyradiculopathy. Sarcoidosis has a predilection for involvement of sensory nerve roots and ganglia but most commonly affects cranial nerve roots and the optic nerves. Patients with neurosarcoidosis often have systemic disease and abnormal findings on neuroimaging, features that were not seen in this patient. Although neurosarcoidosis cannot be ruled out, I will consider other possible causes of this patient's presentation.
