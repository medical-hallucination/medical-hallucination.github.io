Dr. Amrit Misra (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was seen in the outpatient neurology clinic in early autumn due to hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and weakness.

The patient was well until 10 weeks before this presentation when she developed back pain between her shoulder blades, which resolved over 2 weeks without intervention. Six weeks before presentation, she experienced numbness in a bandlike pattern around her trunk, including the area under her breasts.

Five weeks prior, numbness extended to her upper abdomen, causing difficulty sitting up from a supine position without arm support and abdominal distention. Four weeks before presentation, she developed paresthesia in some fingers of both hands. Two weeks before presentation, numbness spread to the genital area, and she developed urinary incontinence, leading her to visit the emergency department for evaluation.

In the emergency department, she reported no fevers, night sweats, weight changes, arm or leg weakness, or gait changes. She had a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and spinal stenosis treated with L4-L5 decompression and bilateral medial facetectomy 6 years earlier. She also underwent open reduction and internal fixation of left tibial and fibular fractures and excision of a right thenar puncture wound.

Three months before presentation, she noticed an 8 cm area of nonpruritic, nonpainful erythema on her left gluteal fold, thought to be an insect bite, which resolved over 4 weeks. Her only medication was levothyroxine, and she had a penicillin allergy. She occasionally drank alcohol, had a past smoking history, and did not use illicit drugs. She was married and lived in northeastern Connecticut, working in health care.

On examination, her temperature was 36.6°C, blood pressure 144/75 mm Hg, heart rate 84 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. She weighed 74.8 kg, with a body mass index of 25.8. There was decreased sensation on her trunk and abdomen, abdominal distention, but the rest of the general examination was normal. Her blood glucose was 291 mg per deciliter and other tests for renal and liver function, blood cell counts, and electrolytes were normal. Imaging studies were conducted.

Dr. H. Benjamin Harvey: MRIs of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine (without contrast) showed no spinal cord compression, cord signal abnormalities, or epidural collections, only multilevel degenerative changes and postsurgical L4-L5 modifications with no severe spinal canal stenosis or nerve-root impingement. The conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots appeared normal, with no thickening or clumping.

Dr. Misra: The patient pursued further neurological evaluation and reported stable hand paresthesia, ongoing trunk and abdomen numbness, new numbness in the upper anterior legs, and difficulty lifting the front of her left foot over the past 5 days. She also reported breathing and coughing difficulties.

On examination, her temperature was 36.4°C, blood pressure 106/67 mm Hg, heart rate 77 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. Mental status was normal, as were cranial nerve tests from 2nd to 12th. Strength testing showed 4/5 in left wrist flexion, 5/5 on grip, 4/5 in left foot dorsiflexion, and 4/5 in left toe extension, otherwise 5/5. She couldn't keep her left forefoot off the ground when walking on heels. Diaphragmatic excursion was symmetrical. Bilateral rectus abdominis muscles had reduced tone, and abdominal distention was observed. Sensation was diminished to light touch and pinprick from T6 to T12 dermatomes. Biceps reflexes were absent on the left, and ankle reflexes were absent bilaterally. The rest of the examination was normal.

Testing showed glycated hemoglobin at 11.8%, with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyrotropin, creatine kinase, vitamin D, B12, and folate levels. 

Dr. Harvey: Chest X-rays showed no parenchymal opacity, pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy. Bilateral hemidiaphragmatic movement was intact. Thoracic and lumbar MRI without contrast showed stable findings compared to previous imaging. Thoracic MRI with contrast showed no abnormal enhancements.

Dr. Misra: A diagnostic test was performed.
