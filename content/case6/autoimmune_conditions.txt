## Autoimmune Conditions

Autoimmune conditions are an important consideration in this case and include Behçet's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA-associated vasculitis, Eales's syndrome, sarcoidosis, and Susac's syndrome. Behçet's syndrome is a vasculitis characterized by oral and genital ulcerations, sometimes associated with neurologic deficits. Ocular manifestations occur in up to 70% of cases and can include severe retinal vasculitis. This patient has no history of oral or genital ulcers, which would suggest Behçet's syndrome.

One-third of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus experience ocular involvement, which can manifest as retinal ischemia due to arteritis. Patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, often associated with lupus, can have arterial retinal occlusions. The patient has a positive test for antinuclear antibodies but no other clinical signs of lupus.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an ANCA-associated vasculitis, can involve the orbit but is unlikely to present with isolated retinal ischemia. Eales's syndrome is a severe retinal vasculitis mostly affecting young men from India, associated with hypersensitivity to tuberculo-protein — unlikely in this patient.

Up to 50% of sarcoidosis patients have ophthalmic complications, including retinal vasculitis. This patient shows arterial involvement, not typical of sarcoidosis, and lacks other symptoms like erythema nodosum.

The key to diagnosing the underlying cause of retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) in this woman is her episodic vertigo. The presence of vestibular dysfunction and BRAO suggests Susac's syndrome — an autoimmune disorder that affects the retina, cochlea, and brain.

Susac's syndrome is characterized by a triad of vision loss, sensorineural hearing loss, and neurologic dysfunction, although only some patients present with all three. Funduscopic examination is vital for identifying retinal ischemia, crucial for diagnosis.

In this patient, audiometry confirms bilateral hearing loss, common in Susac's due to cochlea microangiopathy. Although nystagmus is not observed, it may be suppressed by visual fixation, suggesting vestibular dysfunction could be present.

Retinal fluorescein angiography reveals arterial occlusions consistent with Susac's syndrome. MRI scans could reveal lesions in the corpus callosum that support the diagnosis, as these are distinct from other inflammatory conditions like multiple sclerosis.
