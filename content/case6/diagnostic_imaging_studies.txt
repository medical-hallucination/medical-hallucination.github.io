## Diagnostic Imaging Studies

Dr. Rajiv Gupta: The diagnostic test in this case was MRI of the head (Fig. 3). T1-weighted images obtained before the intravenous administration of contrast material showed hypointense lesions in the central portion of the splenium of the corpus callosum. These lesions were hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and had contrast enhancement on imaging obtained after the administration of contrast material. There were multiple other lesions in the subcortical white matter bilaterally that were hyperintense on FLAIR imaging, and many had contrast enhancement. There was no mass effect associated with these lesions. There were foci of leptomeningeal enhancement. There were also foci of gray-matter enhancement, including a focus in the right thalamus. In the corona radiata, there was diffuse perivascular parenchymal enhancement. Finally, many of the lesions were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and hypointense on apparent-diffusion-coefficient images. Results of magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck were normal.

**Figure 3. MRI of the Head.**  
A T1-weighted image obtained before the intravenous administration of contrast material shows hypointense lesions in the central portion of the splenium of the corpus callosum (Panel A, arrow). The lesions are hyperintense on a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image (Panel B, arrows) and have contrast enhancement on an image obtained after the administration of contrast material (Panel C, arrows). There are multiple other lesions in the subcortical white matter bilaterally that are hyperintense on FLAIR imaging, and many have contrast enhancement. There is no mass effect associated with these lesions. There are foci of leptomeningeal enhancement (Panel D, arrow). In the corona radiata, there is diffuse perivascular parenchymal enhancement (Panel F, arrows). Finally, many of the lesions show hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (Panel G, arrows) and hypointensity on apparent-diffusion-coefficient imaging (Panel H, arrows). There are also foci of gray-matter enhancement, including a focus in the right thalamus (Panel E, arrow). 

The presence of multiple white-matter lesions in this patient may prompt consideration of a demyelinating process, such as multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. However, the presence of leptomeningeal and gray-matter lesions rules out these purely white-matter processes. In addition, the morphologic features of the white-matter lesions in the corpus callosum, which are central rather than peripheral, would be atypical of multiple sclerosis. The distribution of the lesions makes lymphoma and neurosarcoidosis unlikely, and the absence of avid enhancement and mass effect would be atypical of lymphoma.

Multifocal supratentorial white-matter lesions involving the central corpus callosum have been described in Susac's syndrome.9 In this patient, these lesions show a characteristic morphologic feature that has been described as resembling a "string of pearls."10 As seen in this patient, Susac's syndrome may be associated with involvement of the deep gray matter (in 70% of cases), parenchymal enhancement (70%), and leptomeningeal enhancement (33%).6 These MRI findings, in combination with the ophthalmologic findings, are diagnostic of Susac's syndrome.
