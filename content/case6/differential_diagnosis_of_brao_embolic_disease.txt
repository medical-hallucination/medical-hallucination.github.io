## Differential Diagnosis of BRAO: Embolic Disease

Sources of retinal emboli include cholesterol plaque associated with atherosclerosis, platelet-fibrin emboli linked with cardioembolism or disorders of arterial hypercoagulability, and calcific plaque associated with cardiac valvular disease. It is often difficult to distinguish among these entities solely based on the funduscopic appearance of an embolus. Apart from the branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), this patient has no other reported funduscopic abnormalities; there are no visible emboli or vascular abnormalities, and no hemorrhages that would indicate retinal venous occlusion. Her laboratory test results do not suggest antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, protein C deficiency, or protein S deficiency, and she does not have a history of blood clots or miscarriage, which would suggest a hypercoagulable state.
