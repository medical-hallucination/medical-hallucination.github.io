## Differential Diagnosis Of BRAO Embolic Disease

Sources of retinal emboli include cholesterol plaque associated with atherosclerosis, plateletâ€“fibrin emboli associated with cardioembolism or disorders of arterial hypercoagulability, and calcific plaque associated with cardiac valvular disease. It is often difficult to distinguish among these entities on the basis of the funduscopic appearance of an embolus alone.4 Apart from the BRAO, this patient has no other reported funduscopic abnormalities; there are no visible emboli or abnormalities of the vasculature and no hemorrhages, which would indicate retinal venous occlusion. Her laboratory test results are not suggestive of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, protein C deficiency, or protein S deficiency, and she has no history of blood clots or miscarriage, which would suggest a hypercoagulable state.
