## Disorders Of The Optic Nerve

In a young woman, optic neuritis is a relatively common cause of vision loss. However, before we make this presumptive diagnosis, we must consider the available clinical evidence. Several features of this patient's presentation argue against an optic neuropathy. First, her visual acuity is reported to be normal, which can occur but is uncommon in a patient with optic neuritis. Second, the errors on Ishihara color testing are more likely to be explained by the scotoma, which could cause her to miss part of a numeral on a color plate, than by true color desaturation (dyschromatopsia). Third, a patient with acute unilateral optic neuropathy would be expected to have a relative afferent pupillary defect, which is not present in this patient.
