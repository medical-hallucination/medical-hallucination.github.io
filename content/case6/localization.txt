## Localization

The afferent visual system occupies a vast portion of the nervous system, beginning with the tear film and cornea and then encompassing the anterior chamber, crystalline lens, vitreous humor, retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, optic radiation, and striate cortex in the occipital lobe, as well as specialized extrastriate areas in the parietal and temporal lobes.1 What clues allow us to localize the loss of vision in the right eye in this patient? Although she reports vision loss in her right eye, it is not uncommon for patients to misinterpret homonymous vision loss as being in just one eye. This distinction is important for localization. Vision loss that affects the same side of the visual field in each eye localizes to the retrochiasmal pathway, which includes the optic tract, optic radiation, and occipital cortex. Deficits that are confined to just one eye localize to the ocular media, retina, or optic nerve on that side.

In this case, the history and findings on examination confirm that the reported vision loss is confined to the right eye. It is unusual for disorders of the cornea, lens, or vitreous to cause the type of discrete scotoma that is described by this patient. Her vision loss most likely localizes to the optic nerve or retina. It is critical to distinguish between these possibilities, because the types of disorders that affect these two structures can be quite different, with important implications for appropriate management and prognosis.
