## Presentation Of Case

Dr. Seth N. Levin (Neurology): A 23-year-old right-handed woman with a history of migraines was evaluated at this hospital for vertigo and vision loss affecting the right eye.

Six days before admission, a right frontal headache and right retro-orbital pain developed; these features had not been typical of the patient's previous migraines. Five days before admission, the patient awoke with an alteration in her vision, which she described as a "gray dot" approximately 6 cm in diameter (as measured with the use of an Amsler grid held at 12 inches) and was located in the inferonasal field of vision of the right eye. Later that day, she had intermittent diminished vision in the right eye, which she described as "white appearing" and lasting for 45 to 60 seconds at a time. The size of the abnormality was difficult for the patient to define, but the abnormality did not involve the entire field of vision of the right eye. She did not have pain with eye movement, floaters, scintillating scotomata, or fortification spectra. When she covered her right eye, the vision in her left eye was normal.

Three days before admission, several episodes of vertigo occurred. The patient described the vertigo as "room spinning" and lasting for approximately 30 seconds. The vertigo was not provoked by angular head movements. Intermittent nonpositional bifrontal headaches occurred one or two times daily, particularly when the patient was straining her eyes to look at a cellular telephone or computer. She did not have facial numbness, loss of vision with eye movement, or other neurologic symptoms. The abnormality that she had described as a gray dot in the inferonasal field of vision of the right eye remained fixed, and the night before admission, she went to a hospital that specializes in ophthalmology and is affiliated with this hospital.

In the emergency department of the affiliated hospital, the temperature was 36.6°C, the pulse was 79 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 103/64 mm Hg, the respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. On the Ishihara color test, six of eight color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the right eye (two half plates were missed in the area of reported loss of vision) and eight of eight color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the left eye. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupillary defect. Automated perimetry revealed a dense depression in the inferonasal field of vision of the right eye. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed normal adnexa, lids, lashes, conjunctivae, and sclerae, and clear corneas. The anterior chambers, irises, lenses, and vitreous were normal in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in both eyes. The optic nerves were pink, with normal cups and sharp margins. There was an area of mild macular whitening superotemporal to the fovea in the right eye. The vessels appeared normal in both eyes, without emboli, Gass plaques, boxcarring (segmentation of blood in retinal arterioles), or sheathing. Extraocular movements were full bilaterally, without nystagmus.

The next morning, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further diagnostic evaluation. She reported stable visual-field defects and ongoing intermittent headaches. She had had no rash or ulcers. There was a 16-year history of migraines without aura; the migraines occurred every 1 to 3 months, were pulsatile in quality, were associated with sensitivity to light, and resolved with sleep. There was no history of blood clots, miscarriage, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or autoimmune disease. The only medication was an etonogestrel implant. There were no known drug allergies. There was no family history of stroke, hypercoagulability, or cardiac disease. The patient worked in a nursing home and lived alone in eastern Massachusetts. She was sexually active with one male partner, with whom she was in a monogamous relationship. She drank alcohol occasionally and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs.

The results of the ophthalmologic examination had not changed from the examination at the affiliated hospital, and the results of the general and neurologic examinations were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, C-reactive protein, and homocysteine were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests, the prothrombin time, the international normalized ratio, the partial-thromboplastin time, the complete blood count, the differential count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Test results were normal for protein S, protein C, and antithrombin III activity, as well as the prothrombin G20210A mutation and activated protein C resistance. A lupus anticoagulant screen was negative. An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:640 with a speckled pattern, and assays for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), β2-glycoprotein 1 IgM and IgG antibodies, and anticardiolipin IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. A lumbar puncture revealed colorless cerebrospinal fluid, with an opening pressure of 13 cm of water, a glucose level of 62 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a total protein level of 77 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), a total nucleated-cell count of 1 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a red-cell count of 3 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 0 to 5). Low-dose aspirin was administered, and the patient was admitted to the neurology service.

One day after admission, hearing loss and tinnitus of the right ear developed. Audiometry revealed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that was more severe in the right ear than in the left ear, with normal tympanic-membrane mobility bilaterally. On the fourth day, color photographs of the fundus were obtained, and fluorescein angiography was performed to evaluate the retinal vasculature.

Dr. Lucy H. Young: Wide-field photographs of the fundus showed retinal whitening superotemporal to the fovea in the right eye (Fig. 1A) and a subtle area of retinal whitening along the inferotemporal arcade of the left eye (Fig. 1B). Fluorescein angiography revealed delayed filling of two arteriolar branches along the superotemporal arcade of the right eye, with one remaining blocked even at 39 seconds after the administration of fluorescein (Fig. 2A). In the left eye, blocked arterioles were noted in the inferonasal and inferotemporal periphery (Fig. 2B). Images obtained 5 minutes after the administration of fluorescein showed segmental perivascular staining in both eyes (Fig. 2C and 2D).

Dr. Levin: An additional test was performed, and a diagnosis was made.
