## Age

Although late adolescent boys and elderly men are traditionally considered to have the highest risk of suicide, demographic characteristics associated with suicide have evolved over time. Between 1999 and 2016, the rate of death by suicide increased in all age groups between 10 and 75 years of age. This 37-year-old man may not have been considered at particularly high risk, but recent epidemiologic data suggest that no age group should be considered at low risk.
