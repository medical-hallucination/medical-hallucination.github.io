## Age

Although late adolescent boys and elderly men are classically considered to have the highest risk of suicide, the demographic characteristics associated with suicide seem to have changed over time. Between 1999 and 2016, the rate of death by suicide increased in all age groups between 10 and 75 years of age. This 37-year-old man may not have been in an age group with a particularly high risk of suicide, but the most recent epidemiologic data suggest that no age group should be considered to be at low risk.
