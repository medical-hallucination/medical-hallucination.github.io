## Discussion of Further Management — Rapid Response Perspective

Dr. George A. Alba: The patient had an unwitnessed syncopal event with transient loss of consciousness. On arrival of the rapid response team, he was conscious and had new facial contusions and a bleeding laceration above the left eyebrow. The heart rate was 155 beats per minute, the systolic blood pressure 74 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 36 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient communicated that he was having difficulty breathing. His tracheotomy tube was uncapped and positive-pressure ventilation with a bag–valve mask was initiated, without resistance and with an increase in oxygen saturation. The breath sounds were clear, and the chest rose symmetrically with the ventilation. Hypotension persisted, and intravenous crystalloids were administered. Cyanosis developed rapidly, and the patient became unresponsive. He had ongoing electrocardiographic activity but no pulse, features consistent with cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity. Advanced cardiac life support was initiated.

When providers are confronted with in-hospital cardiac arrest, they must rapidly initiate high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), identify the underlying cardiac rhythm, and evaluate for a reversible cause. The rapid response team can identify the cause of cardiac arrest in approximately two thirds of cases. In this case, we responded to a young man who had recent extensive craniofacial surgery, unheralded syncope, sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress with prompt progression to cardiac arrest. We were primarily concerned about the possibility of a massive pulmonary embolus, despite prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin during the hospitalization.

When we evaluated the patient, the primary dilemma was whether to administer thrombolytic agents. Systemic thrombolysis has been associated with the return of spontaneous circulation and with short-term survival among patients with cardiac arrest and confirmed pulmonary embolus. Current guidelines for advanced cardiac life support consider thrombolysis to be a "reasonable" emergency treatment option for patients with confirmed massive pulmonary embolus. However, for patients with cardiac arrest and unconfirmed pulmonary embolus, such as this patient, routine thrombolytic treatment during CPR is not recommended. In this case, the ongoing administration of advanced cardiac life support precluded the performance of contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and head to confirm the diagnosis and identify absolute contraindications to thrombolysis. Empirical systemic thrombolysis was considered, but without a confirmed diagnosis and with multiple relative contraindications and the inability to rule out an absolute contraindication, we chose not to administer alteplase. Despite multiple rounds of CPR and the administration of intravenous epinephrine, the patient remained asystolic and was pronounced dead.
