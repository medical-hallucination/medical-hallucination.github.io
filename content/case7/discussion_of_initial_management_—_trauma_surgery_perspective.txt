## Discussion of Initial Management — Trauma Surgery Perspective

Dr. Peter T. Masiakos: This patient presented with a high-velocity, close-range gunshot wound to the face, with massive destruction of the soft tissue. The presence of complex fracture patterns and associated oral and ocular trauma makes this type of wound quite dramatic. However, if the trajectory of the bullet does not involve the brain, then the injury is usually nonlethal, as in this case.

Although there is a substantial amount of literature on reconstruction in facial gunshot injuries, there is a paucity of data on the initial evaluation and surgical interventions that are necessary for patients with this type of injury. This patient survived the immediate gunshot trauma and was transported to a local facility, where emergency treatment adhered to conventional approaches and advanced trauma lifesupport protocols.

First, the possibility of airway compromise,

the most frequent and life-threatening problem in the trauma unit, was addressed. The patient was awake and could breathe without support. However, because of concerns about the development of bleeding and swelling of the oropharynx, urgent cricothyroidotomy was performed to ensure continued airway control. The patient was then transferred to a tertiary care hospital, where his injuries were further evaluated and the cricothyroidotomy was eventually converted to a formal surgical tracheotomy.

Second, urgent control of bleeding is often necessary in patients who present with gunshot wounds to the face, particularly those who have hemodynamic instability due to active blood loss from the vessels at the base of the skull. In most patients, local surgical control or nasal or oropharyngeal packing in the emergency department effectively stops active bleeding. However, 10% of patients have ongoing hemorrhage and undergo angioembolization to ensure control of hemorrhage from deeper vessels. This patient did not have massive bleeding, and urgent control of bleeding was not necessary. Tamponade of the slow and persistent oropharyngeal blood loss was accomplished with oropharyngeal packing.

Once the airway was definitively secured and bleeding controlled to a satisfactory degree, the patient was transferred to this hospital for subspecialty care that involved the ophthalmology and facial plastic surgery services. Because the patient had ocular involvement, he underwent an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation. During the next several weeks, he subsequently underwent a series of operations that included débridement of injured or necrotic soft tissue, a procedure to address a CSF leak, internal fixation of the maxillofacial bones, coverage of the wounds with skin approximation, and placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. Of note, the timing of reconstruction procedures in patients who present with gunshot wounds to the face is determined by the extent of the injury and soft-tissue loss. However, the outcomes for early and delayed reconstruction appear to be similar. The decision to surgically repair fractures and to cover the wounds with soft tissue is ultimately based on the hemodynamic stability of the patient.
