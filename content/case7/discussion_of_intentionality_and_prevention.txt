** What Happened That Night? **
Dr. Chana A. Sacks: When the patient was admitted to this hospital, he was unable to communicate and the clinical team had minimal collateral history. The patient had reportedly been upset, and a gunshot had been heard thereafter. The team presumed that this had been a suicide at- tempt. However, on the 19th hospital day, once the patient was awake and able to converse with the consulting psychiatrist, he clearly explained,
“It was definitely an accident.” The patient de- scribed the scene in detail. He said that he had been cleaning his gun, which was on its side, when his phone rang. As he reached for the phone, the gun discharged, firing a bullet into his face. He remembered holding his face in his hands and screaming. He acknowledged that he had recently been stressed at work but said that he would never intentionally hurt himself, describing his family as an important anchor in his life. He also described hobbies that he en- joyed, and he did not report feelings of hopeless- ness or despair, stating that he looked forward to returning to his family and his hobbies as he recovered.
Given the disconnect between the patient’s description and the team’s early presumptions about intentionality, additional collateral infor- mation was sought and ultimately obtained from the investigators. A suicide note that described work-related stress, loneliness, and marital strife had been found at the scene of the injury. Inves- tigators noted that the gun had been loaded with a single bullet, which was found lodged in the ceiling, indicating that the gun had been facing upward when it was fired. Alcohol had been present at the scene. It was also reported that, 1 month earlier, police had been called to the house and had found the couple fighting. It was not clear what had prompted that call to police or what action, if any, had been taken in response.

** Risk Factors for Suicide **
With this case now framed as a suicide attempt, we may consider whether it represents an iso- lated tragic incident or reflects a trend in the epidemiology of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that suicide rates across the United States in- creased substantially between 1999 and 2016, with an increase of more than 30% in half the states.3 In 2016, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 45,000 deaths.3,4
This young man, who had no known history of depression and seemed to have a good job and a supportive family, may not immediately strike clinicians as having traditional risk factors for suicide. However, a more thorough evaluation suggests that he had several important risk fac- tors to consider. 

** Age ** 
Although late adolescent boys and elderly men are classically considered to have the highest risk of suicide, the demographic characteristics associated with suicide seem to have changed over time.5 Between 1999 and 2016, the rate of death by suicide increased in all age groups be- tween 10 and 75 years of age.3 This 37-year-old man may not have been in an age group with a particularly high risk of suicide, but the most recent epidemiologic data suggest that no age group should be considered to be at low risk.6

** Mental Health **
This patient had no known history of depression or another mental illness. However, data from 27 states suggest that 54% of people who died by suicide in 2015 had no known history of a mental illness.3 This raises two possibilities: that many people are living with an undiagnosed mental illness, or that depression or other mental illnesses may not be the only driving force lead- ing to suicide. Both statements are probably true.
In fact, evidence suggests that suicide may sometimes be an impulsive act rather than a long-reasoned decision. For example, in one study involving patients who survived a suicide attempt, nearly half reported that the time between the first thought of suicide and the attempt was 10 minutes or less.7 Therefore, the presence of fac- tors that increase impulsivity may be an impor- tant element in the complex act of attempting suicide. This patient, who had stress at work and in his marriage, also had a risk factor associated with increased impulsivity: substance use. He was found to have a markedly elevated blood ethanol level, and although the results of the urine toxi- cology screen were not confirmed, the screen was presumptively positive for methamphetamine.

** Lethal Means **
Whether a suicide attempt results in death is di- rectly related to the means used to commit the act. In the United States, suicide is inextricably linked with gun violence and accounts for nearly two thirds of all firearm-related deaths6; approxi- mately half of suicides are completed with guns.3 Access to a firearm is a risk factor for suicide; the odds of death by suicide among those who have access to a gun are more than 3 times as high as the odds among those who do not.8
Despite the outcome in this case, people who attempt suicide with a firearm rarely get a sec- ond chance, with a fatality rate of approximately 85%, as compared with a rate of approximately 2% among those who attempt suicide by poison- ing or overdose.6,9 It is often assumed that a suicide attempt with a gun may reflect a more determined or serious attempt, but after the pa- tient in this case survived, he did not express a reasoned, consistent desire to end his life but rather a desire to engage in treatment and to live.

** Prevention **
Are there ways to prevent people from dying by suicide that was attempted at an impulsive mo- ment? Changing their access to guns during periods of crisis has the potential to save their lives. Methods of achieving this include efforts to identify patients who are at a potentially ele- vated risk of suicide and to counsel them about safe storage of firearms or voluntary removal of guns from the home, as well as legal interven- tions, such as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (so-called Red Flag laws), which have now been enacted in 13 states.10
Clinical interventions cannot be successful un- less clinicians feel comfortable discussing fire- arm access with patients. Most physicians do not ask their patients about access to firearms, even when the patient has expressed suicidal idea- tion.11-13 In addition, patients and families often do not recognize unsafely stored firearms as a potential risk.14 Since only a minority of patients who die by suicide have a known diagnosis of a mental illness, clinicians who are not in the field of psychiatry may choose to engage with this issue to establish better methods of recog- nizing patients who are at risk of suicide and to implement interventions to assist those pa- tients.
Dr. Virginia M. Pierce (Pathology): Dr. Bloom, would you tell us about this patient’s hospital course?

Dr. Bloom: After the patient underwent multi- ple surgical procedures to address his injuries, preoperative modeling was performed for even- tual reconstruction of the jaw and palate with a free fibula flap. The patient was nearly ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility, but then, at approximately 2:30 a.m. on the 24th hospital day, he was in the bathroom and the nurse heard a thud. The patient was found lying on the floor, and the rapid response team was called.
