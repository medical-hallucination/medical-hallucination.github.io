## Lethal Means

Whether a suicide attempt results in death is directly related to the means used to commit the act. In the United States, suicide is inextricably linked with gun violence and accounts for nearly two thirds of all firearm-related deaths; approximately half of suicides are completed with guns. Access to a firearm is a risk factor for suicide; the odds of death by suicide among those who have access to a gun are more than 3 times as high as the odds among those who do not. Despite the outcome in this case, people who attempt suicide with a firearm rarely get a second chance, with a fatality rate of approximately 85%, as compared with a rate of approximately 2% among those who attempt suicide by poisoning or overdose. It is often assumed that a suicide attempt with a gun may reflect a more determined or serious attempt, but after the patient in this case survived, he did not express a reasoned, consistent desire to end his life but rather a desire to engage in treatment and to live.
