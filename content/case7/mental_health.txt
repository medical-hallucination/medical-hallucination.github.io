## Mental Health

This patient had no known history of depression or another mental illness. However, data from 27 states suggest that 54% of people who died by suicide in 2015 had no known history of a mental illness. This raises two possibilities: that many people are living with an undiagnosed mental illness, or that depression or other mental illnesses may not be the only driving force leading to suicide. Both statements are probably true.

In fact, evidence suggests that suicide may sometimes be an impulsive act rather than a long-reasoned decision. For example, in one study involving patients who survived a suicide attempt, nearly half reported that the time between the first thought of suicide and the attempt was 10 minutes or less. Therefore, the presence of factors that increase impulsivity may be an important element in the complex act of attempting suicide. This patient, who had stress at work and in his marriage, also had a risk factor associated with increased impulsivity: substance use. He was found to have a markedly elevated blood ethanol level, and although the results of the urine toxicology screen were not confirmed, the screen was presumptively positive for methamphetamine.
