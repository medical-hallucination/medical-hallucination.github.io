### Case Presentation

Dr. Jordan P. Bloom (Surgery): The patient, a 37-year-old man, was admitted to the surgical ICU of the second hospital. Upon arrival, the sedative infusion was briefly stopped, and he awakened to voice commands, able to show his thumbs and wiggle his toes. Following irrigation of the facial wounds and performing a tracheotomy, surgical subspecialists evaluated the patient. They recommended transferring him for further management of his facial injuries, and he was admitted to the surgical ICU of this hospital for definitive care.

Additional history was obtained from the patient's wife. The patient was otherwise healthy, took no medications, and had a penicillin allergy, which caused a rash. Residing in a rural part of New England, he lived with his wife and children and had stable employment at a construction company. He owned four firearms, chewed tobacco, did not smoke, and consumed alcohol socially. His sister had opioid-use disorder, and his father had passed away a decade earlier due to unknown reasons.

On examination, the patient was sedated and receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheotomy. His temperature was 38.4Â°C, pulse rate at 86 beats per minute, blood pressure at 133/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate at 14 breaths per minute, with oxygen saturation at 97% while on mechanical support (FiO2, 0.30). The left pupil responded to light, and lung examination revealed coarse breath sounds. Bruising was observed on the left medial forearm, while the rest of the examination remained unremarkable. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and total and direct bilirubin levels were normal; further lab test results are detailed in Table 1.

Management decisions were made.
