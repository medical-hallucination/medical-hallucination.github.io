Dr. Bloom: The patient was admitted to the surgical ICU of the second hospital. On admission, the infusion of sedative medications was briefly paused, and the patient awakened to voice and followed commands to show his thumbs and wiggle his toes. The facial wounds were irrigated, and a standard tracheotomy was performed. During the next day, the patient was evaluated by a team of surgical subspecialists. Ultimately, transfer was recommended for definitive care of the facial injuries, and the patient was admitted to the surgical ICU of this hospital for further treatment.

Additional history was obtained from the patient's wife. The patient was healthy, took no medications, and was allergic to penicillin, which had caused a rash. He lived with his wife and young children in a rural area of New England and had stable employment at a construction company. He reportedly owned four guns, chewed tobacco but did not smoke it, and drank alcohol socially. The patient's sister had opioid-use disorder, and his father had died 10 years earlier of an unspecified cause.

On examination, the patient was sedated and mechanically ventilated by means of tracheotomy. The temperature was 38.4Â°C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/80 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was receiving mechanical ventilatory support (Fio2, 0.30). The left pupil was reactive to light. On examination of the lungs, the breath sounds were coarse. Ecchymosis was present on the left medial forearm. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. The platelet count, red-cell indexes, and blood levels of total and direct bilirubin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Management decisions were made.
