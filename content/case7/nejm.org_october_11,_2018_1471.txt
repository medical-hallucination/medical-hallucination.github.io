## Discussion by Dr. Katrina Armstrong

Dr. Katrina Armstrong (Medicine): Although this discussion has been challenging and upsetting, it is essential for us to come together as health care providers to address the issues raised by this case. The work we do to understand and impact the determinants of health in our communities has a greater effect on our patients than almost anything we can do once they are admitted to our ICU. The findings related to the thrombus, with evidence of endothelialization of the free surface of the thrombus, suggest a thrombus age of approximately one week. A portion of the thrombus dislodged and embolized to the trunk of the pulmonary artery, causing an acute massive saddle embolus and sudden death.
