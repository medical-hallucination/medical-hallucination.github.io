## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Eva D. Patalas: An autopsy was performed in coordination with the office of the chief medical examiner. The most important finding was a large blood clot at the bifurcation of the trunk of the pulmonary artery, a feature consistent with a massive saddle embolus (Fig. 3A and 3B). The lungs were of a normal weight, and examination of the heart revealed no clinically significant dilatation on the right side. Histologic examination of sections from the blood clot and the pulmonary artery wall revealed fibrinous ribbons that were consistent with lines of Zahn, a feature indicative of layered fibrin deposition in a thrombus (Fig. 3C). There was no reaction at the interface between the vessel wall and the thromboembolus, a finding consistent with rapid death (Fig. 3D).

The femoral veins were dissected, and deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the left femoral vein. There was a distinct reaction between the vessel wall and the thrombus, with an area of attachment (Fig. 3E). There was growth of fibroblasts into the thrombus, macrophage infiltration, early capillary formation, and endotheli-
