## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Eva D. Patalas: An autopsy was performed in coordination with the office of the chief medical examiner. The key finding was a large blood clot at the bifurcation of the trunk of the pulmonary artery, indicating a massive saddle embolus. The lungs were of normal weight, and examination of the heart showed no significant dilatation on the right side. Histologic examination of sections from the blood clot and the pulmonary artery wall revealed fibrinous ribbons consistent with lines of Zahn, indicative of layered fibrin deposition in a thrombus. There was no reaction at the interface between the vessel wall and the thromboembolus, consistent with a rapid death.

The femoral veins were dissected, revealing deep-vein thrombosis in the left femoral vein. There was a clear attachment between the vessel wall and the thrombus, with growth of fibroblasts into the thrombus, macrophage infiltration, early capillary formation, and endothelialization of the free surface of the thrombus.
