## Prevention

Are there ways to prevent people from dying by suicide that was attempted at an impulsive moment? Changing their access to guns during periods of crisis has the potential to save their lives. Methods of achieving this include efforts to identify patients who are at a potentially elevated risk of suicide and to counsel them about safe storage of firearms or voluntary removal of guns from the home, as well as legal interventions, such as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (so-called Red Flag laws), which have now been enacted in 13 states. Clinical interventions cannot be successful unless clinicians feel comfortable discussing firearm access with patients. Most physicians do not ask their patients about access to firearms, even when the patient has expressed suicidal ideation. In addition, patients and families often do not recognize unsafely stored firearms as a potential risk. Since only a minority of patients who die by suicide have a known diagnosis of a mental illness, clinicians who are not in the field of psychiatry may choose to engage with this issue to establish better methods of recognizing patients who are at risk of suicide and to implement interventions to assist those patients.

Dr. Virginia M. Pierce (Pathology): Dr. Bloom, would you tell us about this patient's hospital course?

Dr. Bloom: After the patient underwent multiple surgical procedures to address his injuries, preoperative modeling was performed for eventual reconstruction of the jaw and palate with a free fibula flap. The patient was nearly ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility, but then, at approximately 2:30 a.m. on the 24th hospital day, he was in the bathroom and the nurse heard a thud. The patient was found lying on the floor, and the rapid response team was called.
