## Prevention

Are there ways to prevent suicide attempts that occur impulsively? Changing access to guns during periods of crisis can potentially save lives. Methods include identifying patients at risk of suicide and counseling them on safe firearm storage or voluntary removal of guns from the home. Legal measures, such as Extreme Risk Protection Orders (Red Flag laws), enacted in 13 states, can also be effective. Success in clinical interventions hinges on clinicians' comfort with discussing firearm access with patients. Often, physicians do not ask about firearm access, even if the patient exhibits suicidal ideation. Families and patients might not realize the danger of unsecured firearms. Since only a small number of individuals who die by suicide have a diagnosed mental illness, non-psychiatric clinicians may need to engage in better identification methods and interventions for those at risk.

Dr. Virginia M. Pierce (Pathology): Dr. Bloom, could you provide details about this patient's hospital course?

Dr. Bloom: Following multiple surgical procedures to address his injuries, preoperative modeling was done for eventual jaw and palate reconstruction using a free fibula flap. The patient was almost ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility, but at about 2:30 a.m. on the 24th day in the hospital, a nurse heard a thud in the bathroom. The patient was found on the floor, prompting the rapid response team to be called.
