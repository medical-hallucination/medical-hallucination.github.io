## Risk Factors For Suicide

With this case now framed as a suicide attempt, we may consider whether it reflects a trend in the epidemiology of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that suicide rates across the United States increased substantially between 1999 and 2016, with more than a 30% increase in half the states. In 2016, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 45,000 deaths. This young man, who had no known history of depression and appeared to have a good job and a supportive family, might not immediately seem to have traditional risk factors for suicide. However, a more thorough evaluation suggests that he had several important risk factors to consider.
