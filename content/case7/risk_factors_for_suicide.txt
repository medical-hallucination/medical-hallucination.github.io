## Risk Factors For Suicide

With this case now framed as a suicide attempt, we may consider whether it represents an isolated tragic incident or reflects a trend in the epidemiology of suicide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that suicide rates across the United States increased substantially between 1999 and 2016, with an increase of more than 30% in half the states. In 2016, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 45,000 deaths. This young man, who had no known history of depression and seemed to have a good job and a supportive family, may not immediately strike clinicians as having traditional risk factors for suicide. However, a more thorough evaluation suggests that he had several important risk factors to consider.
