## What Happened That Night?

Dr. Chana A. Sacks: When the patient was admitted to this hospital, he was unable to communicate and the clinical team had minimal collateral history. The patient had reportedly been upset, and a gunshot had been heard thereafter. The team presumed that this had been a suicide attempt. However, on the 19th hospital day, once the patient was awake and able to converse with the consulting psychiatrist, he clearly explained, "It was definitely an accident." The patient described the scene in detail. He said that he had been cleaning his gun, which was on its side, when his phone rang. As he reached for the phone, the gun discharged, firing a bullet into his face. He remembered holding his face in his hands and screaming. He acknowledged that he had recently been stressed at work but said that he would never intentionally hurt himself, describing his family as an important anchor in his life. He also described hobbies that he enjoyed, and he did not report feelings of hopelessness or despair, stating that he looked forward to returning to his family and his hobbies as he recovered.

Given the disconnect between the patient's description and the team's early presumptions about intentionality, additional collateral information was sought and ultimately obtained from the investigators. A suicide note that described work-related stress, loneliness, and marital strife had been found at the scene of the injury. Investigators noted that the gun had been loaded with a single bullet, which was found lodged in the ceiling, indicating that the gun had been facing upward when it was fired. Alcohol had been present at the scene. It was also reported that, 1 month earlier, police had been called to the house and had found the couple fighting. It was not clear what had prompted that call to police or what action, if any, had been taken in response.
