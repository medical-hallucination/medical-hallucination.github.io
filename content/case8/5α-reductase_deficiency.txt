## 5α-Reductase Deficiency

The diagnosis of 5α-reductase deficiency should also be considered in this case. 5α-Reductase is an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the primary active hormone in peripheral tissues that induces a male phenotype in the context of an XY genotype. Patients with 5α-reductase deficiency may have female genitalia at birth, but the genitalia are often ambiguous because of the high levels of testosterone. In addition, in patients with 5α-reductase deficiency, there is the potential for virilization at puberty, which was not observed in this patient.
