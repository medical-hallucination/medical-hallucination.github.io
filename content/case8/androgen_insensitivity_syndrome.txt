## Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

Another diagnostic consideration in this case is androgen insensitivity syndrome. Patients with this syndrome have an XY genotype with mutations in the androgen receptor gene, located on chromosome Xq1.1–1.2. Depending on the mutation, the cellular response to androgens varies, which can lead to a complete or partial clinical phenotype. In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, patients have testes and produce high levels of androgens, particularly testosterone. However, due to the absence of a functional androgen receptor, there is no response to these hormones in peripheral tissues either in utero or after puberty. As a result, the wolffian ducts do not develop, and the müllerian ducts regress due to the secretion of antimüllerian hormone by Sertoli cells. Consequently, patients present with female-appearing external genitalia but lack a uterus, cervix, or upper vagina, and have cryptorchidism, with intraabdominal testes or testes in the inguinal canal. They undergo puberty and breast development due to the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatase, but they generally lack axillary or pubic hair. In contrast, individuals with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome might have somewhat ambiguous external genitalia at birth and may exhibit partial virilization during puberty. The clinical features observed in this patient are consistent with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
