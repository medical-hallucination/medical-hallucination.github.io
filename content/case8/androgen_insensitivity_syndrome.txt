## Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

Another diagnostic consideration in this case is the androgen insensitivity syndrome. Patients with this syndrome have an XY genotype and mutations in the androgen receptor gene, which is located on chromosome Xq1.1–1.2. Depending on the mutation, the cellular response that follows binding of androgens to their receptor varies and thus the clinical phenotype may be complete or partial. Patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome have testes and secrete high levels of androgens (particularly testosterone). However, because of the absence of a functional androgen receptor, there is no response to the hormones in peripheral tissues, either in utero or after puberty. As a result, the wolffian ducts do not develop. In parallel, the müllerian ducts regress owing to the secretion of antimüllerian hormone by Sertoli cells. Thus, patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome have female-appearing external genitalia but no uterus, cervix, or upper vagina, and they have cryptorchidism, with either intraabdominal testes or testes at various stages of descent in the inguinal canal. In addition, they undergo puberty and breast development as a result of the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatase, but they have virtually no axillary or pubic hair. In contrast, in patients with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, the external genitalia may be somewhat ambiguous at birth and partial virilization may occur during puberty. The clinical features seen in this patient are consistent with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
