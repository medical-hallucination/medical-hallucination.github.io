## Clinical Diagnosis

Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.

Dr. Virginia M. Pierce (Pathology): Dr. Sacha, what was your clinical impression when this patient was evaluated in the fertility center?

Dr. Sacha: During the first visit, the principal diagnostic considerations were müllerian aplasia, including müllerian aplasia with premature ovarian insufficiency or with 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis, as well as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Several days later, the antimüllerian hormone level was found to be markedly elevated (579 ng per milliliter; reference range, 0.9 to 9.5), and the chromosome analysis revealed a 46,XY karyotype. These results were consistent with the diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Additional laboratory tests were performed; the total testosterone level was markedly elevated (877 ng per deciliter; reference range for women, <50), as were the levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (692 μg per deciliter; reference range, 31 to 228) and inhibin B (496 pg per milliliter; reference range, <139 in premenopausal women during the follicular phase, <92 in premenopausal women during the luteal phase, and <10 in postmenopausal women). An MRI of the pelvis was performed as the next step in the evaluation.
