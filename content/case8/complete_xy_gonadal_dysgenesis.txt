## Complete XY Gonadal Dysgenesis

Another diagnostic consideration in this case is complete XY gonadal dysgenesis (known as the Swyer syndrome), which results from the absence of the SRY gene or its gene product. When SRY is absent, the testis is also absent, and patients with complete XY gonadal dysgenesis have streak gonads, which are devoid of germ cells, and internal m√ºllerian structures, including a hypoplastic uterus and cervix. The clinical presentation may include delays in breast development, puberty, and menarche. The diagnosis is usually made at birth or during childhood, and gonadal excision is recommended because of an associated risk of gonadal cancers. Given the absence of a uterus and cervix in this patient, the diagnosis of complete XY gonadal dysgenesis can be ruled out.
