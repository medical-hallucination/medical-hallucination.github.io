## Complete XY Gonadal Dysgenesis

Complete XY gonadal dysgenesis, also known as Swyer syndrome, is a condition characterized by the absence of the SRY gene or its gene product. This results in the absence of testes, and patients exhibit streak gonads devoid of germ cells as well as internal m√ºllerian structures such as a hypoplastic uterus and cervix. Clinically, these patients may experience delayed breast development, puberty, and menarche. Typically, this diagnosis is made at birth or during childhood, and gonadal excision is recommended due to the potential risk of gonadal cancers. However, in the case being considered, the absence of a uterus and cervix suggests that complete XY gonadal dysgenesis is unlikely.
