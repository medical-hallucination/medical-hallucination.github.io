Dr. Christos Coutifaris: This 31-year-old woman with primary amenorrhea had been told when she was 16 years of age that she had no uterus or ovaries. She had had a growth spurt and nor- mal thelarche and adrenarche when she was 12 years of age. On physical examination, the height was 172.7 cm (>90th percentile for women), the vaginal length was normal, and no uterus or cervix was present. On the basis of these find- ings, it is likely that her underlying disorder stemmed from an abnormality of sexual differ- entiation.
To provide context for a discussion of the dif- ferential diagnosis, it is useful to first review the process of sexual differentiation (Fig. 1). Go- nadal differentiation depends on the presence or absence of a Y chromosome and specifically on expression of the SRY gene, which maps to the short arm of the Y chromosome (Yp). Expression of SRY mediates the development of the undif- ferentiated gonad into a testis. Then, fetal testos- terone secretion occurs, leading to the develop- ment of the wolffian ducts and ultimately to a typical male genital phenotype. In addition, se- cretion of antimüllerian hormone by the Sertoli cells of the fetal testis induces regression of the müllerian ducts. In the absence of a Y chromo- some (and SRY expression) and in the presence of two intact X chromosomes, female gonadal and phenotypic differentiation occurs, with ovarian development, a typical female genital phenotype, and reproductive function of typical onset and duration.1 At which point might the typical process of sexual differentiation have gone awry in this patient?

** Steroidogenic Enzyme Defects in an XY Genotype ** 
Defects of enzymes involved in early steroido- genesis in the context of an XY genotype may lead to a clinical phenotype similar to that seen in this patient.2 In 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydro- genase deficiency, androstenedione (a weak an- drogen) is synthesized but testosterone is not. Because the fetus is not exposed to a potent androgen,typicalmalegenitaldifferentiationdoes not occur. However, patients with 17β-hydroxy- steroid dehydrogenase deficiency usually under- go virilization during puberty if the testes have not been removed, and such virilization was not seen in this patient.
A deficiency of P450c17, an enzyme complex that mediates the activity of both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, would lead to profound fetal androgen deficiency. Patients with this condition have female external genitalia at birth, as did this patient. However, patients with this condi- tion would be expected to present with an adre-
nal crisis early in life because the synthesis of glucocorticoids would be impaired. Milder defi- ciencies of P450c17 can result in delayed pu- berty, hypokalemia, and hypertension. Overall, given the absence of relevant clinical character- istics in this patient, these steroidogenic enzyme defects can be ruled out.

** Complete XY Gonadal Dysgenesis **
Another diagnostic consideration in this case is complete XY gonadal dysgenesis (known as the Swyer syndrome), which results from the ab- sence of the SRY gene or its gene product.3 When SRY is absent, the testis is also absent, and pa- tients with complete XY gonadal dysgenesis have streak gonads, which are devoid of germ cells, and internal müllerian structures, including a hypoplastic uterus and cervix. The clinical pre- sentation may include delays in breast develop- ment, puberty, and menarche. The diagnosis is usually made at birth or during childhood, and gonadalexcisionisrecommendedbecauseofan associated risk of gonadal cancers.4 Given the absence of a uterus and cervix in this patient, the diagnosis of complete XY gonadal dysgenesis can be ruled out.

** 5α-Reductase Deficiency **
The diagnosis of 5α-reductase deficiency should also be considered in this case.5 5α-Reductase is an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydro- testosterone, the primary active hormone in pe- ripheral tissues that induces a male phenotype in the context of an XY genotype. Patients with 5α-reductase deficiency may have female genita- lia at birth, but the genitalia are often ambigu- ous because of the high levels of testosterone. In addition, in patients with 5α-reductase defi- ciency, there is the potential for virilization at puberty, which was not observed in this patient.

** Leydig-Cell Hypoplasia ** 
Leydig-cell hypoplasia results from a mutation that inactivates the G-protein–coupled luteiniz- ing hormone receptor in the context of an XY genotype.6 Such a mutation leads to a defect in fetal androgen production by Leydig cells, re- sulting in a female genital phenotype. However, secondary sexual characteristics do not develop and puberty does not occur in patients with Leydig-cell hypoplasia. Given that thelarche and adrenarche had been normal in this patient, Leydig-cell hypoplasia can also be ruled out.

** Müllerian Aplasia **
Patients with müllerian aplasia (known as the Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hausersyndrome)have an XX genotype. They lack all derivatives of the müllerian ducts (fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina) but have ovaries and undergo puberty, with appropriately timed breast devel- opment and growth of axillary and pubic hair.7-9 Such patients are endocrinologically typical fe- males, and they have typical female external genitalia at birth but have amenorrhea due to the absence of a uterus. Some cases are associated with specific gene deletions or sporadic muta- tions. In müllerian aplasia type 1, which is the most common type, only the reproductive organs are affected. Müllerian aplasia type 2 is associ- ated with abnormalities in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys or skeleton. Müllerian aplasia is a plausible diagnosis in this patient, because it could explain the absence of a uterus and cervix in a patient with female external genitalia and normal thelarche and adrenarche.

** Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome **
Another diagnostic consideration in this case is the androgen insensitivity syndrome.10-15 Patients with this syndrome have an XY genotype and mutations in the androgen receptor gene, which is located on chromosome Xq1.1–1.2. Depending on the mutation, the cellular response that fol- lows binding of androgens to their receptor var- ies and thus the clinical phenotype may be com- plete or partial. Patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome have testes and secrete high levels of androgens (particularly testoster- one). However, because of the absence of a func- tional androgen receptor, there is no response to the hormones in peripheral tissues, either in utero or after puberty. As a result, the wolffian ducts do not develop. In parallel, the müllerian ducts regress owing to the secretion of antimül- lerian hormone by Sertoli cells. Thus, patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome have female-appearing external genitalia but no uterus, cervix, or upper vagina, and they have cryptorchidism, with either intraabdominal testes
or testes at various stages of descent in the in- guinal canal. In addition, they undergo puberty and breast development as a result of the periph- eral conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatase, but they have virtually no axillary or pubic hair. In contrast, in patients with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, the external genitalia may be somewhat ambiguous at birth and partial virilization may occur during puberty. The clinical features seen in this patient are con- sistent with complete androgen insensitivity syn- drome.

** Summary **
On the basis of the history and findings on ex- amination, the most likely diagnosis in this case is either müllerian aplasia or complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (Table 2). In a review of the laboratory data, the most interesting find- ing, which helps to distinguish between these two diagnoses, is the low level of follicle-stimu- lating hormone (FSH) noted on two separate measurements despite an elevated level of lutein- izing hormone. This pattern of gonadotropin secretion would not be observed in females who have a normal menstrual cycle. Furthermore, if premature ovarian insufficiency were present, the FSH level would be elevated and would also be higher than the luteinizing hormone level, and both hormones would be at menopausal levels. In contrast, the low level of FSH is consis- tent with complete androgen insensitivity syn- drome. As opposed to the regulation of lutein- izing hormone, which is dependent solely on feedback from gonadal steroids, the regulation of FSH is dependent on feedback from both gonadal steroids and inhibin.16 In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, the low levels of circulat- ing estrogens lead to minimal negative feedback and the high levels of androgens (particularly testosterone) do not lead to feedback that causes inhibition of gonadotropins, owing to the ab- sence of a functional androgen receptor in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. However, Sertoli cells secrete copious amounts of inhibin B, which selectively inhibits FSH secretion by gonadotropic cells. Given that the FSH level was suppressed in this patient, I hypothesize that she had hypersecretion of inhibin B, possibly from a tumor. Maybe the fullness on the left side that was noted on the pelvic examination represented a tumor in a testis. In general, gonadal tumors that are associated with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are germ-cell tumors (usually gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma, or sem- inoma). However, Sertoli-cell adenomas and tumors of the Sertoli and Leydig cells are also common.17 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be helpful in confirming the presence of testes and evaluating for an associated tumor in this patient.
Dr. Virginia M. Pierce (Pathology): Dr. Sacha, what was your clinical impression when this patient was evaluated in the fertility center?
Dr. Sacha: During the first visit, the principal diagnostic considerations were müllerian aplasia — including müllerian aplasia with premature ovarian insufficiency or with 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis — as well as complete androgen in- sensitivity syndrome. Several days later, the anti- müllerian hormone level was found to be mark-edly elevated (579 ng per milliliter; reference range, 0.9 to 9.5), and the results of the chromo- some analysis revealed a 46,XY karyotype. These results were consistent with the diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. At this time, additional laboratory tests were per- formed; the total testosterone level was markedly elevated (877 ng per deciliter; reference range for women, <50), as were the levels of dehydroepi- androsterone sulfate (692 μg per deciliter; refer- ence range, 31 to 228) and inhibin B (496 pg per milliliter; reference range, <139 in premeno- pausal women during the follicular phase, <92 in premenopausal women during the luteal phase, and <10 in postmenopausal women). As the next step in the evaluation, MRI of the pelvis was performed.
