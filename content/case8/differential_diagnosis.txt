## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Christos Coutifaris: This 31-year-old woman with primary amenorrhea had been told when she was 16 years old that she had no uterus or ovaries. She had experienced a growth spurt and normal thelarche and adrenarche when she was 12 years old. On physical examination, her height was 172.7 cm (>90th percentile for women), the vaginal length was normal, and no uterus or cervix was present. Based on these findings, it is likely that her underlying disorder stemmed from an abnormality of sexual differentiation.

To provide context for a discussion of the differential diagnosis, it is useful to first review the process of sexual differentiation. Gonadal differentiation depends on the presence or absence of a Y chromosome and specifically on the expression of the SRY gene, which maps to the short arm of the Y chromosome (Yp). Expression of SRY mediates the development of the undifferentiated gonad into a testis. Then, fetal testosterone secretion occurs, leading to the development of the Wolffian ducts and ultimately to a typical male genital phenotype. Additionally, secretion of antimüllerian hormone by the Sertoli cells of the fetal testis induces regression of the müllerian ducts. In the absence of a Y chromosome (and SRY expression) and in the presence of two intact X chromosomes, female gonadal and phenotypic differentiation occurs, with ovarian development, a typical female genital phenotype, and reproductive function of typical onset and duration.
