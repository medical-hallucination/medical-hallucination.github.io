## Discussion of Urologic Management

Dr. Adam S. Feldman: The patient was referred to the urology clinic for management of intraabdominal gonads. She requested that discussions with her husband remain vague and that the term "testes" not be used, highlighting the potential psychological effects of the diagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome on patients and their families.

Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is often diagnosed during childhood, during inguinal hernia repair, or at puberty, when primary amenorrhea is noted. Approximately 50% of patients with this syndrome have an inguinal hernia, and 1 to 2% of female patients with an inguinal hernia have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. During childhood, any female patient undergoing inguinal hernia repair would typically also have a routine vaginoscopy or laparoscopy to rule out intraabdominal testes. This case is notable because the patient reached adulthood without a specific diagnosis. The risk of testicular cancer in adults with intraabdominal testes is approximately 1 to 2%, compared to 5.7 per 100,000 in the general population. The risk is extremely low for patients whose testes are removed before puberty.

In this case, surgical removal of the intraabdominal gonads was recommended due to the cancer risk. The optimal timing for orchiectomy in pediatric patients is challenging and an individualized approach is crucial. The gonads produce estradiol, contributing to female phenotype development, so it is often preferred to leave the gonads until puberty is complete. Timely gonadectomy is crucial for patients with palpable testes or an inguinal hernia. It's essential to ensure a diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity syndrome since virilization can occur in partial insensitivity, making early gonadectomy preferable. Additionally, the presence of intraabdominal testes and its psychological effects must be carefully considered and discussed with postpubertal female patients.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated bilateral laparoscopic orchiectomy. After surgery, estrogen-containing hormone-replacement therapy was initiated. No progestin was required due to the absence of a uterus.
