## Figure 2. MRI of the Pelvis.

A sagittal T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows a vagina that is normal in length (arrowhead). The uterus and cervix are absent. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel B) shows gonads (arrows) in the anterior pelvis, with multiple cysts (arrowheads) around the gonads. No definite follicles are shown. An axial T1-weighted, fat-saturated image, obtained after the administration of contrast material (Panel C), shows symmetric, homogeneous enhancement of both gonads (arrows).
