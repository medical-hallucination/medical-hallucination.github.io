## Leydig-Cell Hypoplasia

Leydig-cell hypoplasia results from a mutation that inactivates the G-proteinâ€“coupled luteinizing hormone receptor in the context of an XY genotype. Such a mutation leads to a defect in fetal androgen production by Leydig cells, resulting in a female genital phenotype. However, secondary sexual characteristics do not develop and puberty does not occur in patients with Leydig-cell hypoplasia. Given that thelarche and adrenarche had been normal in this patient, Leydig-cell hypoplasia can also be ruled out.
