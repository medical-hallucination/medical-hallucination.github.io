## Müllerian Aplasia

Patients with müllerian aplasia (known as the Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome) have an XX genotype. They lack all derivatives of the müllerian ducts (fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina) but have ovaries and undergo puberty, with appropriately timed breast development and growth of axillary and pubic hair. Such patients are endocrinologically typical females, and they have typical female external genitalia at birth but have amenorrhea due to the absence of a uterus. Some cases are associated with specific gene deletions or sporadic mutations. In müllerian aplasia type 1, which is the most common type, only the reproductive organs are affected. Müllerian aplasia type 2 is associated with abnormalities in other parts of the body, such as the kidneys or skeleton. Müllerian aplasia is a plausible diagnosis in this patient, because it could explain the absence of a uterus and cervix in a patient with female external genitalia and normal thelarche and adrenarche.
