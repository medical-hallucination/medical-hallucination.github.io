## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Esther Oliva: The right testis weighed 19 g and measured 5.3 cm by 2.5 cm by 0.6 cm, and the left testis weighed 24 g and measured 4.1 cm by 2.6 cm by 2.1 cm (Fig. 3). Each testis had cystic structures in the superior portion (measuring 2.1 cm by 2.2 cm by 1.2 cm in the right testis and 1.6 cm by 1.1 cm by 1.1 cm in the left testis) and white, firm cordlike structures in the inferior portion. Sectioning of the testes revealed multiple tan nodules of various sizes within a soft, darker brown parenchyma. On microscopic examination, the most striking feature was the presence of multiple hamartomas, which were composed of small elongated, straight tubules lined by immature Sertoli cells, admixed with occasional spermatogonia. The tubules were separated by groups of Leydig cells and stroma with varied hyalinization. The Leydig cells sometimes formed small hyperplastic aggregates, whereas the ovarian-type stroma was located focally within the testicular parenchyma. Adnexal cysts, which were lined by simple cuboidal-to-columnar epithelium that was focally associated with cilia, were adjacent to primitive remnants of wolffian duct. In the paratesticular areas, marked smooth-muscle hyperplasia was present.

In patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, the testes are found in an abnormal location, most often the abdomen (in approximately 80% of cases). The testes typically have three components: Sertoli-cell tubules with associated occasional spermatogonia, Leydig cells, and stroma that may be reminiscent of ovarian-type stroma. All three components were seen in this patient. These components undergo a spectrum of morphologic changes before, during, and after puberty. Most striking is the development of multiple bilateral nonencapsulated Sertoli-cell hamartomas within the testicular parenchyma after the first decade of life. Such hamartomas are often composed of Sertoli-cell tubules admixed with Leydig cells (seen in this patient), but on rare occasions, the hamartomas may be predominantly or solely composed of an ovarian-type stroma.

In patients with the androgen insensitivity syndrome, sex cord–stromal tumors may develop; these are most commonly Sertoli-cell adenomas, which can be distinguished from hamartomas by the paucity or absence of Leydig cells. In very few patients, a tumor that resembles a sex cord tumor with annular tubules may develop. Of utmost concern is the potential for the development of malignant germ-cell tumors, most commonly seminomas. Although the risk of the development of seminoma is lower with the androgen insensitivity syndrome than with other disorders of sexual development, the risk increases over time. An epididymis or ductus deferens may develop in patients with the androgen insensitivity syndrome, although this is uncommon; remnants of wolffian duct are noted in approximately 25% of patients. Fallopian tubes have been reported in up to 36% of patients. Smooth-muscle hyperplasia (seen in this patient) may occur in the tunica albuginea of the inferior pole and in the caudal portion of the epididymis, and thus leiomyomas may develop. Cystic structures that are juxtaposed to the testes (also seen in this patient) may be derived from either wolffian or müllerian ducts and may become large.

Figure 3. Orchiectomy Specimens. A photograph of the specimen (Panel A) shows that the testes are replaced by multiple well-defined nodules of various sizes, with a homogeneous, white–to–tannish‑yellow cut surface. On hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel B), testicular nodules and paratesticular cysts are shown. At higher magnification (Panels C through F), the nodules are composed of immature, fetal Sertoli‑cell tubules within a fibromatous background (Panel C). The Sertoli‑cell tubules are composed of cells with small, round, uniform nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm (Panel D); no germ cells are shown. The tubules are surrounded by Leydig cells with larger nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Panel D, arrow) and are admixed with an ovarian‑type stroma (Panel E, arrow). Evidence of smooth‑muscle hyperplasia is shown at the edge of the testis (Panel F).
