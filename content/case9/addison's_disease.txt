## Addison's Disease

Addison's disease is characterized by the onset of fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Hypotension and fever can also develop in the context of adrenal crisis. When eosinophilia is present, it is often mild, with the absolute eosinophil count rarely rising above 1000 per cubic millimeter. This patient had some symptoms that were compatible with a diagnosis of Addison's disease, including fever and fatigue. However, his overall clinical presentation did not fit well with this diagnosis, and his degree of eosinophilia was higher than would be expected.
