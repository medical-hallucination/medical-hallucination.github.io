## Allergy

In areas that do not have a substantial burden of parasites, allergic reactions to drugs are the most common cause of eosinophilia. Manifestations of drug-induced eosinophilia can range from an asymptomatic process to a process with clinically significant end-organ involvement, such as the DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome. Symptoms of the DRESS syndrome often develop 2 to 8 weeks after the initiation of a new drug, and many drugs have been implicated in the DRESS syndrome, including proton-pump inhibitors and statins, two classes of medications that this patient had been taking for many years.

The European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) provides a scoring system to estimate the likelihood that a patient has the DRESS syndrome. According to this scoring system, this patient meets the criteria for definite DRESS syndrome (Table 2). Although this diagnosis fits well with the clinical features in this case, the trigger for the DRESS syndrome is unclear, since omeprazole and rosuvastatin were not new medications for this patient. He noted that he had started to take new pain medications approximately 5 weeks before admission, but details about these medications are unknown, making it difficult to associate them with his illness. A reevaluation of the case details would be necessary to determine whether there were any potential triggers for the DRESS syndrome.
