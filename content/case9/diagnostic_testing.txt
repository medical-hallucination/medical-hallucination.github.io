## Diagnostic Testing

Dr. Eng: The diagnostic test, a quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay of the peripheral blood for HHV-6, was performed 2 days after admission, approximately 3 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms. The test was positive, at a viral load of 112,836 copies per milliliter (reference range, <500). Two weeks after the initial testing, the viral load decreased to less than 500 copies per milliliter. Both the absolute viral load and the relatively rapid decrease in viral load helped to rule out the possibility of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 as the cause of the elevated viral load. Of note, HHV-6 has the capacity to integrate into the human genome; this occurs in approximately 1% of the general population. After the virus integrates into the genome, very high viral loads (often >1 million copies per milliliter) can be detected in the blood but do not necessarily indicate active infection.

Serum HHV-6 IgM and IgG antibody titers were also obtained. The IgM antibody titer was elevated, at higher than 1:320 (reference range, <1:20), and the IgG antibody titer was also elevated, at higher than 1:10,240 (reference range, <1:10). These findings further support the diagnosis of HHV-6 infection. Elevated IgM and IgG antibody titers can be identified in the context of acute HHV-6 seroconversion or reactivation, and results from a previous HHV-6 serologic panel would be required to definitively distinguish between these two scenarios. Overall, these test results support the diagnosis of an HHV-6 mononucleosis-like illness associated with the DRESS syndrome.
