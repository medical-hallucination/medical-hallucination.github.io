## Discussion of Management

Dr. Tsiaras: Once the diagnosis of the DRESS syndrome is established, prompt identification and discontinuation of the causative drug are mandatory. The most frequently encountered culprit medications include antibiotics (e.g., sulfonamides) and anticonvulsant, antiviral, antipyretic, and analgesic agents. In most cases, clinical judgment is sufficient to determine the most likely causative drug. For more challenging cases, clinical tests such as patch tests and lymphocyte transformation tests aid in identifying the causative agent. Correct identification and immediate withdrawal of the causative drug are associated with improved outcomes and prevention of future episodes of the DRESS syndrome.

After the suspected causative drug is withdrawn, supportive therapy is provided. If erythroderma is present or the body surface is extensively affected by exfoliative dermatitis, treatment in a specialized intensive care unit or burn unit may be required. Diagnostic studies are often repeated to monitor for visceral organ involvement. Despite prompt discontinuation of the causative drug, symptoms of the DRESS syndrome typically last for more than 15 days and may persist for several months. Continued close follow-up is recommended until complete resolution of symptoms.

Guidelines for the treatment of the DRESS syndrome are limited, and evidence for systemic treatment is derived from case series and expert opinion. Systemic glucocorticoids are considered first-line therapy. A dose of prednisone of 1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, with gradual tapering over 3 to 6 months, is often recommended. In milder cases, high-potency topical glucocorticoids may suffice. Glucocorticoid-sparing agents such as intravenous immune globulin, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab have been used in some cases with varying efficacy. The use of antiviral drugs effective against HHV-6 has been proposed for the treatment of patients with confirmed HHV-6 reactivation; however, evidence is insufficient to support such treatment.

This patient's cutaneous eruption diminished over the course of his hospitalization; only hydrated petrolatum was used for the dry desquamation. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy was not initiated, as a workup for lymphadenopathy was ongoing. At discharge, his eosinophil count had normalized, and liver-function tests were improving. One week after discharge, persistent periorbital edema was noted, but lymphadenopathy and cutaneous eruption had diminished. He was advised to take 20 mg of prednisone daily for 4 days for persistent facial edema. Six weeks after discharge, the patient noted dry skin but no rash. Lymphadenopathy had further diminished, facial edema resolved, and laboratory test results were normal. The patient was taking no medications and had returned to work.

Dr. Dudzinski: It is important to identify the medication likely to have caused the DRESS syndrome in this patient. Were you able to narrow down the list?

Dr. Tsiaras: Unfortunately, despite multiple efforts by the primary inpatient team, the precise medication remains unknown. Reviewing all available medical records from the other hospital showed that they, too, were unable to identify which new drug had been prescribed. The patient had taken several over-the-counter medications he could not recall. It was unlikely that the statin or omeprazole was the culprit, given he had used them for several months. Additionally, the patient may have taken an over-the-counter NSAID for analgesia, but he had been taking aspirin for a long time, suggesting the effect might relate to a specific NSAID rather than the broad class. If he had received the recommended outpatient follow-up, patch testing could have been considered to help identify the culprit agent. Unfortunately, sometimes we have incomplete information in patient care.
