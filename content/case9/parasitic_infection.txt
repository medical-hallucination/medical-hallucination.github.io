## Parasitic Infection

Most parasitic infections cause eosinophilia due to the migration of organisms through tissues. Parasites are typically found in specific geographic areas, and such infections often occur after residency or travel to areas where the parasite is endemic. This patient, born in New England with minimal travel history, had potential exposure limited to two parasites linked with eosinophilia: *Trichinella spiralis* and *Toxocara* species.

Trichinellosis is caused by *Trichinella spiralis* and results from consuming infected undercooked pork or wild game. Clinical features include fever, myalgias, facial edema, and rash, with common laboratory findings of eosinophilia and elevated creatine kinase levels. Although this patient had fever, periorbital edema, rash, and eosinophilia, myalgias were not prominent and the creatine kinase level was normal. Nearly all patients with trichinellosis experience myalgias and elevated creatine kinase levels. The absence of these findings, as well as exposure to *Trichinella spiralis*, rules out this diagnosis.

Toxocariasis is due to ingestion of soil contaminated with dog or cat feces containing *Toxocara canis* or *T. cati* cysts. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, urticarial rash, pulmonary, and ocular symptoms, and eosinophilia. Although the patient presented with some of these features, his symptoms and findings cannot be fully explained by toxocariasis, and a lack of exposure history makes this diagnosis unlikely.
