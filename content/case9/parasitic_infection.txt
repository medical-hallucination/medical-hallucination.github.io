## Parasitic Infection

Most parasitic infections cause eosinophilia because of migration of organisms through tissues. Parasites are typically present in specific geographic areas, and parasitic infections frequently occur after a patient has resided in or traveled to an area in which the parasite is endemic. This patient had been born in New England and had a minimal travel history, and thus, his potential exposure was limited to two parasites that are associated with eosinophilia: *Trichinella spiralis* and *Toxocara* species.

Trichinellosis is caused by *Trichinella spiralis*, and the infection occurs through ingestion of infected undercooked pork or wild game meat. Clinical features include fever, myalgias, facial edema, and rash, and common laboratory abnormalities include eosinophilia and an elevated creatine kinase level. This patient had several findings that were consistent with a diagnosis of trichinellosis, including fever, periorbital edema, rash, and eosinophilia; however, myalgias were not a prominent feature of his presentation, and the creatine kinase level was normal. Nearly all patients with trichinellosis have myalgias, and an elevated creatine kinase level is seen in the majority of cases. The absence of these findings, combined with the absence of exposure to *Trichinella spiralis*, rules out this diagnosis.

Toxocariasis results from the ingestion of dirt that has been contaminated with dog or cat feces containing the cysts of *Toxocara canis* or *T. cati*, respectively. Clinical and laboratory features include fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, urticarial rash, pulmonary, and ocular symptoms, and eosinophilia. Although this patient presented with some of these features, his constellation of symptoms and findings cannot be explained solely by toxocariasis, and the absence of a history of exposure makes this diagnosis unlikely.
