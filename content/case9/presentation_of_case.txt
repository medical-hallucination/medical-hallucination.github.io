Dr. William G. Tsiaras: A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of fever, chills, myalgias, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash.

The patient had been in his usual state of good health until about 3 weeks before admission, in the late spring, when he noted the onset of fevers, chills, headache, and diffuse myalgias. He thought that he had influenza. Five days later, he noted an erythematous rash affecting his trunk, legs, feet, and hands. One day after that, mild, diffuse abdominal discomfort developed, along with anorexia and multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea. During the next 5 days, he had positional dizziness with syncope. Fourteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient sought medical attention at another hospital.

At the other hospital, examination revealed that the patient had fatigue and a diffuse erythematous rash. The temperature was 37.7°C. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an absolute eosinophil count of 600 per cubic millimeter (reference range at the other hospital, 0 to 200) and elevated levels on liver-function tests. CT of the chest, performed without intravenous contrast, reportedly revealed mild, diffuse enlargement of lymph nodes, up to 9 mm in diameter in the mediastinum and up to 15 mm in diameter in the porta hepatis. A nasopharyngeal swab test for influenza A and B viruses, a throat swab test for streptococcal antigen, and blood tests for babesia DNA, ehrlichia DNA, hepatitis A, B, and C virus antibodies, HIV p24 antigen and antibody, and Lyme disease IgM antibody were negative. The patient was treated with an unknown antibiotic and discharged after 5 days with prescriptions for cetirizine and hydroxyzine. He was scheduled for follow-up with his primary care physician.

The day before admission, the patient observed new mild swelling of the face and hands, with blisters on the palms. He was seen by his primary care physician the next day and reported persistent fevers, chills, rash with blistering, anorexia, and positional light-headedness. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Based on advice from a rheumatologist, the patient was given one dose of oral prednisone and was referred to the emergency department.

Additional history obtained in the emergency department revealed pruritus in areas of the previous leg rash, fatigue, chronic pain in the cervical spine and low back, and a mostly intentional weight loss of 11 kg over the previous 15 weeks. He had no known exposures to animals or insects. He had a history of hyperlipidemia, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included aspirin, mirtazapine, rosuvastatin, omeprazole, cetirizine, and hydroxyzine for pruritus as needed. He reported starting a new over-the-counter medication for pain approximately 5 weeks before admission but had stopped taking it at the onset of symptoms. He could not recall the name of this new medication. He had no adverse reactions to medications. His family history was notable for lung cancer in his mother and diabetes and coronary artery disease in his father.

He smoked two packs of cigarettes daily and used marijuana once weekly for the past 30 years. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He worked as a manual laborer and driver and had not traveled outside of New England. He was single and used barrier protection in multiple female sexual contacts; the young grandchild of his current partner had recently had a self-limited febrile illness with a diffuse maculopapular, erythematous rash.

On examination, the patient appeared fatigued. The temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate was 89 beats per minute, the blood pressure was 132/57 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation was 98% on ambient air. The weight was 79 kg, and the body-mass index was 28.1. He had mild periorbital edema and mild exfoliative scale on the temple and forehead. A blanching, maculopapular rash was present on the trunk. On the arms, legs, and dorsal feet, there were thin, faintly violaceous plaques with mild exfoliative scale. Small flaccid bullae, some hemorrhagic, were noted on several fingers and the palms, with a few having ruptured. He had no rash on mucosal surfaces or nail changes. There were mildly tender, mobile lymph nodes in the bilateral cervical, submandibular, axillary, and inguinal distributions, including a 1-cm axillary node and a 2-cm inguinal node. Mild abdominal tenderness was noted in the upper quadrants, with hepatosplenomegaly. The stool was guaiac-negative. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Blood levels of thyrotropin, creatine kinase, troponin T, amylase, lipase, and vitamin D were normal, as were the serum osmolality, basophil count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The patient was admitted to the general medicine unit. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed atypical-appearing mononuclear cells.

Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: On the second hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after intravenous contrast administration. There were areas of centrilobular emphysema, bronchial-wall thickening, scattered pulmonary nodules (2 to 3 mm in diameter) in the upper lobes, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. There was also splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.2 cm; normal ≤12.0 cm), with a splenic cyst.

Dr. Tsiaras: On the third hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.4°C, and the heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the urine and blood were obtained. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed mild, diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia.
