## Presentation Of Case

Dr. William G. Tsiaras: A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of fever, chills, myalgias, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash.

The patient had been in his usual state of good health until about 3 weeks before admission, in the late spring, when he noted the onset of fevers, chills, headache, and diffuse myalgias. He thought that he had influenza. Five days later, he noted an erythematous rash affecting his trunk, legs, feet, and hands. One day after that, mild, diffuse abdominal discomfort developed, along with anorexia and multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea. During the next 5 days, he had positional dizziness with syncope. Fourteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient sought medical attention at another hospital.

At the other hospital, examination revealed that the patient had fatigue and a diffuse erythematous rash. The temperature was 37.7°C. Laboratory evaluation was notable for an absolute eosinophil count of 600 per cubic millimeter (reference range at the other hospital, 0 to 200) and elevated levels on liver-function tests. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, reportedly revealed mild, diffuse enlargement of lymph nodes, which were up to 9 mm in diameter in the mediastinum and up to 15 mm in diameter in the porta hepatis. A test of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses, a rapid test of a throat swab for streptococcal antigen, and tests of the blood for babesia DNA, ehrlichia DNA, hepatitis A virus antibody, hepatitis B virus surface antibody and surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) p24 antigen and antibody, and Lyme disease IgM antibody were negative. The patient was treated with an unknown antibiotic agent, and after 5 days, he was discharged with prescriptions for cetirizine and hydroxyzine. He was scheduled for follow-up with his primary care physician.

The day before admission, the patient observed new mild swelling of the face and hands, with blisters on the palms. He was seen by his primary care physician the next day, and he reported persistent fevers, chills, rash with blistering, anorexia, and positional light-headedness. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

† Reference values are affected by many variables, including the patient population and the laboratory methods used. The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.

Based on advice from a rheumatologist located in the same office, the patient was given one dose of oral prednisone and was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.

Additional history was obtained in the emergency department. The patient reported pruritus in the areas of the previous leg rash, fatigue, chronic pain in the cervical spine and low back, and a mostly intentional weight loss of 11 kg over the previous 15 weeks. He had had no known exposures to animals or insects. He had a history of hyperlipidemia, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included aspirin, mirtazapine, rosuvastatin, omeprazole, and cetirizine, as well as hydroxyzine as needed for pruritus. He reported that he had started to take a new over-the-counter medication for the treatment of pain approximately 5 weeks before admission but had stopped taking it at the onset of his presenting symptoms. He could not recall the name of this new medication. He had had no adverse reactions to medications. His family history was notable for lung cancer in his mother and diabetes and coronary artery disease in his father;

Figure 1. Clinical Photographs of the Rash. The patient presented with a polymorphous eruption, including violaceous plaques with exfoliative scale on the dorsal feet (Panel A), flaccid bullae on the palms (Panel B), and a blanching, maculopapular rash on the trunk (Panel C).

there was no history of autoimmune or dermatologic disorders. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes daily and marijuana once weekly for the past 30 years. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. He worked as a manual laborer and driver. He had not traveled outside of New England. He was single and had had multiple female sexual contacts but had always used barrier protection; the young grandchild of his current sexual partner had recently had a self-limited febrile illness with a diffuse maculopapular, erythematous rash.

On examination, the patient appeared fatigued.

The temperature was 37.1°C, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, the blood pressure 132/57 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. He had mild periorbital edema and mild exfoliative scale on the temple and forehead. A blanching, maculopapular rash was present on the trunk. On the arms, legs, and dorsal feet, there were thin, faintly violaceous plaques with mild exfoliative scale. Small flaccid bullae, including some that were hemorrhagic, were noted on several fingers and the palms, and a few had ruptured (Fig. 1). He did not have a rash on mucosal surfaces or nail changes. There were mildly tender, mobile lymph nodes in the bilateral cervical, submandibular, axillary, and inguinal distributions, including a 1-cm axillary node and a 2-cm inguinal node. There was mild abdominal tenderness in the upper quadrants, with hepatosplenomegaly. The stool was guaiac-negative. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Blood levels of thyrotropin, creatine kinase, troponin T, amylase, lipase, and vitamin D were normal, as were the serum osmolality, basophil count, prothrombin time, and activated partial-thromboplastin time. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

The patient was admitted to the general medicine unit. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed atypical-appearing mononuclear cells.

Dr. Shaunagh McDermott: On the second hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material. There were areas of centrilobular emphysema and bronchial-wall thickening, scattered pulmonary nodules (2 to 3 mm in diameter) in the upper lobes, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes (Fig. 2A and 2B). There was also splenomegaly (spleen length, 15.2 cm; normal length, ≤12.0 cm), with a splenic cyst (Fig. 2B).

Dr. Tsiaras: On the third hospital day, the temperature rose to 38.4°C, and the heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the urine and blood were obtained. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed mild, diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia,

Figure 2. Imaging Studies. CT was performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material. An axial image of the chest (Panel A) shows enlarged right hilar (arrow) and subcarinal (arrowhead) lymph nodes. A coronal image of the abdomen (Panel B) shows enlarged periportal lymph nodes (arrow) and splenomegaly (asterisk). Ultrasound images of the leg (Panel C) show an enlarged right inguinal lymph node (asterisk), with preservation of a normal fatty hilum.

A positron‑emission tomographic scan (Panel D) shows lymphadenopathy with intense 18F‑fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and diffuse increase in FDG uptake in the spleen.

with a level of IgG lambda M component in the gamma region of 0.07 g per deciliter. Levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. McDermott: Ultrasonography of the legs and arms was negative for venous thrombosis; however, enlarged lymph nodes were noted incidentally (Fig. 2C). CT with positron-emission tomography (PET) was performed on the sixth hospital day. There were multiple lymph nodes with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the axillary, cervical, supraclavicular, paratracheal, hilar, subcarinal, portal, iliac, and inguinal distributions, and there was a diffuse increase in FDG uptake in the spleen (Fig. 2D).

Dr. George Eng: Flow cytometry of a peripheral-blood specimen was negative for a monotypic B-cell population and for T cells with immunophenotypic abnormalities. Biopsy of an enlarged right inguinal lymph node was performed on the seventh hospital day; histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed florid paracortical hyperplasia, without evidence of cancer (Fig. 3). Flow cytometry of the biopsy specimen was negative for cancer.

Dr. Tsiaras: Diagnostic test results were received.
