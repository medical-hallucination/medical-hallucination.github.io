## Discussion Of Management

Dr. Philip J. Saylor: There are two key questions in the treatment of this patient: what is this patient's prognosis, and what is the best treatment approach? The natural history of renal-cell carcinoma associated with fusion of *TFEB* is not well described because the tumor type is so rare. TFEB translocation tumors account for a clinically significant proportion of pediatric renal cancers but are rare in adults. Clinical suspicion would be higher in young adults than in older adults. Among reported cases, distant metastases are unusual but have occurred. This patient had a favorable tumor stage (T2) and no nodal involvement, suggesting a low risk of tumor recurrence and hence a good prognosis.

Should this patient be treated with adjuvant systemic therapy after surgery? Adjuvant therapy has a limited role in the management of renal-cell carcinoma. The most-studied agents for adjuvant treatment are sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib, which are multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. All three agents have failed to improve outcomes in a phase 3 study. The use of sunitinib resulted in prolonged disease-free survival in a study that involved only patients with clear-cell carcinoma. Although these results led to the approval of sunitinib by the Food and Drug Administration, sunitinib has limited activity in nonâ€“clear-cell carcinoma. In this patient, who had a rare variant likely associated with a good prognosis, we recommended postoperative surveillance with physical examination, metabolic blood panels, and imaging every 3 to 6 months. We also referred the patient for genetic counseling to discuss his tumor and potential implications for his family members.

Dr. Othon Iliopoulos: The decision to refer a patient with renal-cell carcinoma for genetic counseling is informed by factors associated with an increased incidence of germline mutations, such as the onset of disease at an age younger than 45 years, or a personal or family history of renal-cell carcinoma or extrarenal lesions associated with hereditary forms of the disease. This patient's age and family history, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor in his mother and skin melanoma in his father, provide a compelling case for genetic evaluation. Specifically, patients with a germline mutation in the SDH family of genes may present with a personal or family history of renal-cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, or pituitary tumor. Patients with a germline mutation in *BAP1* may present with renal-cell carcinoma in the context of a personal or family history of Spitz tumors, melanoma, or mesothelioma. Finally, patients with a germline mutation in *MITF* may present with renal-cell carcinoma and melanoma.

Targeted exome sequencing of this patient's tumor revealed no mutations in the VHL, MET, FH, FLCN, SDH, TSC1/2, PTEN, *MITF*, *BAP1*, CDKN2B, or *PBRM1* genes. Although not formal germline testing, it's reasonable to assume germline mutations would be captured by exome sequencing of the tumor. Nevertheless, we recommend genetic counseling and testing for germline mutations. Targeted exome sequencing revealed germline variants of unknown significance in the KPR1B, GPR124, PDGFRA, SF3B1, FGFR4, and *JAK2* genes. The identification of germline variants of unknown significance presents a clinical challenge in the postgenomic era, where high-throughput sequencing information is increasingly available. Currently, we cannot use this information to identify family members at risk.

Dr. Dudzinski: Dr. Salari, how is the patient doing now?

Dr. Salari: It has been 2 years since the surgery. He is doing well, with no evidence of recurrent disease or metastasis on surveillance imaging. He has returned to work, and his wife delivered their second child.

Dr. Mitchell Benson: Although patients with large renal tumors have a higher recurrence rate than those with smaller tumors, outcomes associated with partial nephrectomy have not significantly differed from those with radical nephrectomy, provided resection results in negative margins. Did you consider a partial nephrectomy in this patient, who may be at increased risk for cancer in the contralateral kidney in the future?

Dr. Salari: We typically favor nephron-sparing approaches, when possible, for patients with an increased risk of future renal cancer, such as those with an inherited renal cancer syndrome. However, due to the size and location of the mass, a partial nephrectomy was not technically feasible in this case.

Dr. Dahl: We have learned a great deal about nephron-sparing surgery in the past two decades, and we strive to preserve as much renal function as possible. As a lesion becomes larger, there is a higher chance of venous invasion and a lower chance of obtaining a clear margin. Size correlates with the aggressiveness of the tumor, so a partial nephrectomy is generally not considered, except in rare circumstances, such as in a patient with a tumor in a solitary kidney or severely compromised renal function, where a partial nephrectomy might preclude the need for dialysis.

Dr. Francis J. McGovern: Given the association with melanoma development, would you implement a dermatologic screening protocol in a patient with a germline mutation in *MITF*?

Dr. Iliopoulos: I absolutely would. Dermatologic screening is potentially lifesaving for patients with a mutation in *MITF*, and lifetime surveillance for melanoma would be conducted.
