## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Chin-Lee Wu: The specimen submitted for pathological evaluation was a spherical 10.5-cm, well-circumscribed, golden yellow, solid, and cystic mass confined to the kidney. Microscopic examination revealed no invasion of adjacent fat or vasculature, and all resection margins were negative. The renal parenchyma not associated with the mass was normal, with no additional tumor nodules. Larger cells with abundant clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm were arranged in large and small nested patterns. However, a focal population of smaller cells was surrounded by the larger cells, admixed with eosinophilic hyalinized material. This suggested the diagnosis of t(6;11) TFEB (encoding transcription factor EB) translocation renal-cell carcinoma.

Immunohistochemical examination revealed diffuse expression of PAX8, supporting a renal tubular origin. The tumor cells were negative for carbonic anhydrase IX, usually expressed in clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma, and the cells were focally positive for CD117 (c-Kit). However, this level of expression was insufficient to support the diagnosis of chromophobe renal-cell carcinoma. Epithelial markers commonly expressed in most renal-cell tumors were underexpressed; epithelial marker A was not detected, and cytokeratin expression was weak. The tumor cells expressed melanocytic markers, including strong expression of melan-a and patchy expression of HMB45. This profile supports the diagnosis of t(6;11) TFEB translocation renal-cell carcinoma. The diagnosis was confirmed by detecting TFEB translocation with fluorescence in situ hybridization using a dual-color breakapart probe.

TFEB belongs to the MiT family of genes, which includes MITF, TFE3, TFEB, and TFEC. These proteins can homodimerize and heterodimerize, bind to enhancer-box DNA sequences, and activate specific genes. Translocations involving TFE3 and TFEB can occur in renal-cell carcinoma. The 2016 World Health Organization classification lists these tumors as MiT family translocation renal-cell carcinomas, including Xp11 renal-cell carcinoma (TFE3 fusion) and t(6;11) renal-cell carcinoma (TFEB fusion). These tumors are disproportionately observed in young adults and pediatric patients, with underexpression of epithelial markers and overexpression of melanocytic markers and their respective genes. A genetic assay to detect gene fusion can be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
