## Renal Cancer

I suspect that in this patient, renal cancer is most likely, although this diagnosis is rare in young adults. The fast-growing lesion and prominent distortion of the renal parenchyma on CT are highly suggestive of this diagnosis. If this patient had renal cancer, what type of cancer would be most likely?

Lymphoma of the kidney is characterized by a diffuse infiltrative pattern on imaging, and the patient had no fever, chills, or night sweats (B symptoms); these factors make lymphoma an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Transitional-cell carcinoma can arise in the renal pelvis, but the urinalysis did not show any blood in the urine and the mass did not appear to have arisen from the renal collecting system. If a mass the size of this patient's mass were transitional-cell carcinoma, it would probably have already spread to other sites in the body, and there was no evidence of metastatic disease on CT of the chest and abdomen. Papillary tumors usually appear homogeneous on imaging, which is not consistent with the cystic degeneration and findings on CT. Wilms' tumors are extremely rare in adults; they are typically thought of as pediatric prepubertal tumors, but they can occur in young adults. In addition, Wilms' tumors are often associated with metastases at the time of presentation.
