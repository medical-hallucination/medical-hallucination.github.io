## Spermatocele

The patient had a cyst on the right side of the epididymal head, which is a common intrascrotal finding and is probably a spermatocele. A spermatocele is a cystic dilation of the epididymal tubes, containing spermatozoa. It most commonly occurs at the head of the epididymis, adjacent to the superior pole of the testis. In rare cases, a spermatocele is associated with congenital renal cystic anomalies due to the common embryonic mesodermal origin of the kidneys and epididymis. In such cases, the spermatocele is usually associated with multiple cystic changes. Therefore, the solitary, small spermatocele in this patient is unlikely to be related to the renal mass.

Patients with von Hippel–Lindau syndrome may present with renal and paratesticular masses. A predominantly solid mass, such as a cystadenoma, can develop in the epididymis of these patients. However, this patient did not present with other features of von Hippel–Lindau syndrome, such as multiple renal cancers that usually develop by the third decade of life, or cysts in the pancreas, kidneys, or retinal, spinal, or cerebellar abnormalities.
