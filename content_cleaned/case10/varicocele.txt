## Varicocele

The patient had a varicocele on the left side, which is common in men. A varicocele is a chronic dilation of veins around the testes that occurs because the gonadal veins draining from the testicle to the upper retroperitoneum lack internal valves. A varicocele on the right side is uncommon, due to the angle of insertion of the right gonadal vein into the vena cava, resulting in a functional valve effect that keeps venous pressures low. Although rare, the development of an acute varicocele can indicate compression of the vena cava or an obstruction in the gonadal vein, potentially suggesting a retroperitoneal process or testicular cancer. However, the presence of a left-sided varicocele in this patient, along with a large mass in the right retroperitoneum, does not offer significant diagnostic information in this case.
