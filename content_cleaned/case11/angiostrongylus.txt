## Angiostrongylus

Angiostrongyliasis is caused by two species of nematodes. *Angiostrongylus costaricensis* is prevalent in Central America, including Guatemala. Humans can become incidental hosts by consuming intermediate or transport hosts, such as snails, slugs, freshwater crabs, or shrimp. This invasive helminth migrates to the ileocecal region and releases eggs into the intestinal wall, leading to inflammation, mass lesions, and often peripheral eosinophilia. This patient's exposure to freshwater crayfish and shrimp in Guatemala raises concerns about angiostrongyliasis.
