## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Anna K. Rubin: This 66-year-old woman from Guatemala presented to the community health center with facial pain, treated presumably for temporomandibular joint dysfunction, resulting in resolution of her symptoms. Following recommended care for new immigrants, routine vaccinations and screening tests, including age-appropriate cancer screening and testing for *M. tuberculosis* infection, were offered. An interferon-Î³ release assay for *M. tuberculosis* was positive, yet chest radiography did not show signs of pulmonary tuberculosis. On a subsequent visit to discuss treatment of latent tuberculosis, the patient reported a new 2-month history of right-sided abdominal pain, distinct from her chronic abdominal pain of approximately 30 years. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, appropriately given her age, unexpected weight loss, and exposure history. This study revealed a mass in the ascending colon, confirmed by colonoscopy. Although colon cancer is a common cause of colonic masses, the colonic biopsy did not indicate cancer. However, with colonic biopsy having only a 60% negative predictive value, cancer cannot be definitively ruled out, and thus remains a priority in my differential diagnosis. Despite the concern for cancer, other potential causes of a colonic mass are considered, utilizing key findings such as eosinophilia and the patient's exposure history to guide differential diagnosis development.
