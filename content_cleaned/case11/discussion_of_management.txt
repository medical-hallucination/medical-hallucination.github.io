## Discussion of Management

Dr. Gregory K. Robbins: This patient's history of abdominal pain and exposure to freshwater crabs in Central America raised concerns about *A. costaricensis* infection. While other parasitic infections can affect the blood vessels, they typically involve microfilariae rather than adult forms. The presence of an adult nematode in the abdominal vasculature strongly suggests *A. costaricensis* infection.

Two species of the Angiostrongylus genus cause disease in humans. *A. cantonensis* is associated with eosinophilic meningitis in parts of Asia. *A. costaricensis*, initially found in Costa Rica, has been reported throughout Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. The definitive hosts are rats, marmosets, and coati, in which adult parasites lay eggs excreted in feces. These eggs can be ingested by paratenic hosts, such as snails, slugs, freshwater crabs, and crayfish. Human infections typically occur through consuming undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish or produce contaminated by snails or slugs. Incubation lasts from 3-4 weeks to several months.

Most cases of *A. costaricensis* infection resolve without intervention. Severe cases can necessitate surgery for diagnosis and treatment. In children, infection can mimic appendicitis and often is found incidentally during surgery. There is no established role for anthelmintic therapy, which may initially exacerbate the condition. Since the worm in this patient was resected, we did not recommend further treatment. We suggested empirical therapy with ivermectin, given the likelihood of strongyloidiasis, another frequent cause of eosinophilia. Plans also include treating latent tuberculosis infection.

As this patient will divide her time between Guatemala and New England, we advised precautions to prevent reinfection. She should avoid consuming undercooked snails, crayfish, prawns, or frogs. If handling slugs or snails, she should wear gloves and wash her hands thoroughly afterward. We also recommended washing fruits and vegetables well or consuming only cooked produce, due to potential contamination by mollusk slime.
