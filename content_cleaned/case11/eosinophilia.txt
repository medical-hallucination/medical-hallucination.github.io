## Eosinophilia

Eosinophilia was noted on laboratory tests that were performed during this patient's initial visit to the community health center. The most common cause of eosinophilia worldwide is parasitic disease, and screening for eosinophilia is important in new immigrant and refugee patients, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic parasitic diseases in this population. Before considering parasitic infections, possible nonparasitic causes of eosinophilia need to be considered.

Allergic conditions, such as drug hypersensitivity, are the most common cause of eosinophilia in industrialized countries. Because allergic conditions rarely lead to an absolute eosinophil count of more than 1500 per cubic millimeter, they are unlikely in this patient, who had an absolute eosinophil count of 2633 per cubic millimeter. This patient did not have any symptoms that would suggest an inflammatory cause of eosinophilia, such as vasculitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, or sarcoidosis. However, eosinophilic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease remain possible. Nonparasitic infections that can be associated with eosinophilia include fungal infections, human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, but these conditions are unlikely to explain the colonic mass seen in this patient.
