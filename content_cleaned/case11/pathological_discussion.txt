## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Deshpande: The resected specimen included portions of the cecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum, as well as the appendix. On gross examination, the colonic wall was thickened and fibrosed, but no discrete mass was visible. On histologic examination, the colonic wall had eosinophils, including several microabscesses. There was transmural fibrosis, and vascular channels exhibited necrotizing inflammation. Medium-sized colonic arteries were infiltrated by histiocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. A single arterial channel showed an intraluminal fragment with an intensely eosinophilic appearance. Examining a second section revealed an intravascular structure resembling a parasite with a cuticle-like external layer beneath which internal organs were present, albeit degenerated.

**Figure 3. Colectomy Specimens.** On hematoxylin and eosin staining, the submucosa of the colon shows two foci of vasculitis (arrows). Elastin staining reveals the arterial channel surrounded by elastic fibers, and focal fragmentation of the elastic fibers is present (arrow). On hematoxylin and eosin staining at higher magnification, a single arterial channel displays an intraluminal fragment with an intensely eosinophilic appearance (arrow), surrounded by an infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils. Another section shows an intravascular structure resembling a nematode in the center of the vessel (arrowhead), with transmural inflammation of the surrounding vessel (arrow). Trichrome staining highlights the nematode, revealing a cuticle-like external layer (arrow) and internal organs (asterisk).

The presence of intravascular material with a cuticle-like surface and an internal structure supports the diagnosis of infection with an intravascular nematode. The absence of a well-preserved adult nematode and of eggs, embryos, and larvae complicated definitive identification of the species, but Angiostrongylus costaricensis was a prime consideration in this patient from Guatemala, who had involvement of the mesenteric vasculature. The eggs, embryos, and larvae of A. costaricensis induce an inflammatory reaction, and the intravascular nematodes can initiate thrombosis of arterial channels. Long-standing infection can induce fibrosis and mass-forming cecal lesions, such as the one observed in this patient.

This patient had characteristic histologic findings associated with A. costaricensis infection, including massive transmural eosinophilic infiltration and eosinophilic vasculitis with an intravascular nematode. In cases where the parasite is not identified, the differential diagnosis may include vasculitis involving the gastrointestinal tract, which can have a similar histologic appearance to A. costaricensis infection, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. However, the presence of an adult nematode rules out gastrointestinal vasculitis in this patient.
