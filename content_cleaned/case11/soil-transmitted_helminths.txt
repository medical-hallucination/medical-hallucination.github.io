## Soil-Transmitted Helminths

Soil-transmitted helminths include *Ascaris lumbricoides*, *Trichuris trichiura*, and hookworm. These so-called neglected diseases are prevalent worldwide, including in Guatemala and the United States. Eosinophilia often occurs early during infection, as larvae migrate through tissues before settling in the gastrointestinal tract. A moderate or high organism load must usually be present in the gastrointestinal tract for symptoms to occur. Gastrointestinal manifestations vary and can include dysentery-like syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease-like syndromes, and inflammatory mass lesions, similar to those seen in this patient.
