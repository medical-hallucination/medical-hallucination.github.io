## Mural Thrombi Associated With Cardiomyopathy

Mural thrombi associated with cardiomyopathy result from stasis in left ventricular blood flow and can cause widespread systemic embolization. The incidence of mural thrombi is likely underestimated, occurring in 5 to 8% of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In this case, mural thrombi are unlikely because the risk of embolism with mural thrombi is about 10 to 15%, even without anticoagulation, and patients with mural thrombi typically have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%, compared to 35% in this patient. Additionally, there was no evidence of a dyskinetic segment on TTE, and the ventricular dysfunction was probably of recent onset. It should also be noted that the echocardiography windows in this patient were limited, an opacification agent for detecting a left ventricular thrombus was not used, and echocardiography is less sensitive than cardiac MRI for detecting a thrombus (23% vs. 88%).
