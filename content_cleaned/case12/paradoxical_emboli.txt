## Paradoxical Emboli

Paradoxical embolism involves the passage of venous thromboemboli into the arterial circulation, leading to systemic embolization. This can occur via a patent foramen ovale, frequently found in the general population. The patient had been hospitalized, was sedentary, and likely in a hypercoagulable state due to pneumonia, conditions that align with paradoxical emboli. However, echocardiography with agitated saline showed no shunt, and arm and leg ultrasonography revealed no thrombus. Although paradoxical emboli appear unlikely here, the echocardiography occurred during the patient's mechanical ventilation, potentially limiting shunt detection due to the unlikelihood of a Valsalva maneuver, despite positive-pressure ventilation raising right atrial pressure and enhancing potential right-to-left shunting. The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) offers greater sensitivity for patent foramen ovale detection. Lastly, administering the agitated saline to a vein in the arm, rather than the leg, could reduce the sensitivity for detecting a patent foramen ovale.
