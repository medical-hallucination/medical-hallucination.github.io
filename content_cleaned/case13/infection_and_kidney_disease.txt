## Infection and Kidney Disease

Some infections (e.g., hepatitis B or C virus infection, human immunodeficiency virus infection, syphilis, and staphylococcal infection) may cause kidney disease, and some may aggravate existing kidney conditions, such as IgA nephropathy or anti-GBM disease, or may drive the cause of kidney disease. This case contains many clues. Could the patient have received an infection from his wife or grandchildren or during his recent travel to Mexico? The list of possible transmissions is long. Since the patient was known to have diverticular disease, his intermittent lower abdominal cramping and discomfort were most likely due to colitis or diverticulitis. He began to receive antibiotic therapy, which was broadened to provide coverage of the gram-negative anaerobes that grew in the blood culture. There are over two dozen genera of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, and *Bacteroides fragilis* and *Fusobacterium nucleatum* lead the list of possibilities in this case. An endovascular infection of the aortic aneurysm or a cardiac valve is possible but unlikely, given the absence of vegetations on echocardiography and the relatively normal periaortic region on CT.
