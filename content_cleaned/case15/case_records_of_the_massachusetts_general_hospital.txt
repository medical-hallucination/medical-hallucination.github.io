## Case 22-2018: A 64-Year-Old Man with Progressive Leg Weakness, Recurrent Falls, and Anemia

### Presentation of Case

Dr. Molly E. Wolf: A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of progressive leg weakness, recurrent falls, and anemia.

The patient had been in his usual health until 8 months before admission when he developed fatigue on exertion and subjective leg weakness. Over 3 months, the distance he could walk became shorter due to fatigue and leg weakness. Intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias developed in his feet, and two lower teeth became loose and fell out without preceding trauma.

Four months before admission, he fell in his garage, attributing it to tripping over an object. He did not hit his head, lose consciousness, or need assistance afterward. He reported increased alcohol consumption (up to 6-7 glasses of wine each night) and voluntarily restricted food intake for weight loss. He was counseled on unhealthy alcohol use but declined alcohol-cessation referral. During the next 4 months, fatigue and leg weakness progressed, requiring him to use his arms to rise from a seated position. He had three additional falls, describing his legs as "giving out" while walking.

On evaluation in the clinic, he reported mild pain above the left eye, no headache, neck pain, back pain, urinary retention, or fecal incontinence. He had a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, osteoarthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and previous gastric bypass surgery. Medications included allopurinol, amlodipine, furosemide, indomethacin, losartan, and others. He lived alone and worked as a store manager.

The physical examination showed purple ecchymoses on the left side of his face and flank, brown ecchymoses around the right eye, and absent lower front teeth. Motor strength was reduced, and he could not rise from a seated position without arm use. There was diminished perception of pinprick and light touch in the legs. Reflexes were normal, but hair was thin and fragile on the arms and absent on the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal. He was referred to the emergency department for further evaluation.

A diagnostic test was performed.
