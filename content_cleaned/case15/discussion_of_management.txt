## Discussion of Management

Dr. Fatima C. Stanford: Essential vitamins and nutrients are absorbed in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, and patients who have undergone bariatric surgery are at risk for vitamin deficiencies. After bariatric surgery, patients receive lifelong daily vitamin supplementation, which includes a multivitamin, vitamin B12, calcium citrate with vitamin D3, and vitamin D3 alone. The most common deficiencies include calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and iron, while the least common deficiencies are in vitamin B1 (thiamine), copper, and zinc. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which this patient had undergone, was once the most common bariatric procedure, now surpassed by sleeve gastrectomy. When assessing a patient who has had bariatric surgery, it is important to note the type of procedure, as associated vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies vary. For example, copper deficiency occurs in 10 to 20% of patients after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, but there is only one case of copper deficiency post sleeve gastrectomy. This patient had vitamin D and B12 supplements, and a thiamine supplement was added due to alcohol use, but he was not taking a daily multivitamin, putting him at risk for deficiencies, such as in vitamin C and folate. This highlights the need for all medical team members to stress the importance of complete vitamin supplementation post-bariatric surgery.

Dr. Schmitt: My experience with this patient underscores the importance of routinely asking about alcohol use, especially in long-term patients. This patient had been sober but resumed drinking due to the stress of his divorce. I might have identified this earlier had I consistently used validated screening tools like the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Testâ€“Concise (AUDIT-C) during follow-ups. While I screen new patients with the AUDIT-C, I do not regularly rescreen established patients. Rescreening patients with a history of alcohol-use disorders or stressful life events allows for the detection of problematic alcohol use and can lead to appropriate interventions. A short intervention from a caring professional can reduce harmful drinking and identify patients who need further counseling or medication.

After hospital discharge, I saw this patient monthly for three months. At three months post-discharge, he had made an excellent recovery and was maintaining sobriety. He walked without a cane and returned to full-time work. His orthostatic hypotension and anemia resolved, and the hair on his arms grew back. Unfortunately, three months later, he relapsed into alcohol use despite engaging in treatment for alcohol-use disorder, leading to a fall during intoxication and death from a cerebral hemorrhage.
