## Cushing's Syndrome

Cushing's syndrome refers to a constellation of signs and symptoms caused by excess exposure to glucocorticoids. This patient presented with typical findings such as leukocytosis with lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, irritability, anxiety, and proximal muscle weakness. Some forms of Cushingâ€™s syndrome carry a risk of venous thrombosis that is about 10 times the risk in the general population. Therefore, the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, along with a strong family history of venous thromboses, could explain the development of pulmonary embolism in this patient. Increased cardiac wall thickness can occur in patients with Cushing's syndrome, even among those who are not hypertensive. This phenomenon might be due to activation of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, possibly alongside a genetic predisposition to cardiac hypertrophy. Encouragingly, left ventricular hypertrophy tends to improve with treatment for Cushing's syndrome. Additionally, certain forms of Cushing's syndrome might involve increased activation of the androgen receptor, potentially explaining the hirsutism and alopecia in this patient.

What underlies Cushing's syndrome in this instance? Cushing's syndrome from exogenous glucocorticoid administration is significantly more prevalent than endogenous forms, which appear in fewer than 5 cases per 1 million patient-years. This patient reported no use of glucocorticoids, which would have primarily led to adrenal atrophy. The bilateral adrenal enlargement observed in the patient substantially indicates endogenous Cushing's syndrome, where causation is discerned using corticotropin levels.
