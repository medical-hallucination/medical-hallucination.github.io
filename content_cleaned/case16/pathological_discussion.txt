## Pathological Discussion

Dr. Glomski: On exploration of the mediastinum, a nodule in the thymus was identified and surgically resected. Gross examination revealed a solid, fleshy, tannish pink mass (1.6 cm in diameter) with a poorly demarcated interface and surrounding thymic fat. Microscopically, the mass corresponded to a dense, nested proliferation of cells that infiltrated into adjacent fat and contained foci of necrosis. At higher magnification, neoplastic cells exhibited a nested architecture, abundant amphophilic cytoplasm, and round, regular central nuclei with fine-to-coarse puncta of chromatin ("salt and pepper pattern"), typical of neuroendocrine cells. A low level of mitotic activity (1 mitosis per 10 high-power fields) was observed. Immunohistochemical staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin A showed diffuse positivity, indicative of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Additionally, staining for corticotropin was diffusely positive in tumor cells, indicating the thymic nodule as the source of ectopic corticotropin secretion in this patient. The low mitotic rate and a low Ki-67 proliferation index supported a diagnosis of a well-differentiated thymic neuroendocrine tumor with ectopic corticotropin secretion. Multiple foci of lymphatic invasion at the tumor periphery were identified, suggesting the possibility of residual tumor beyond the surgical resection margins.

Figure 3. Resection Specimen. A photograph of the resection specimen (Panel A) shows a tannish pink, fleshy mass (1.6 cm in diameter) (arrows) within soft, yellow, lobulated fatty thymic tissue. The interface between the mass and the thymic fat is irregular, suggestive of infiltrative growth. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel B) reveals a highly cellular mass with nested architecture (arrowheads), focal necrosis (asterisks), and infiltration into surrounding adipose tissue (arrows). At higher magnification (Panel C), neoplastic cells possess round, regular central nuclei with fine-to-coarse puncta of chromatin ("salt and pepper pattern") (arrows), typical of neuroendocrine differentiation, with scattered lymphocytes (arrowheads) admixed with tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A, a neuroendocrine marker (Panel D), reveals strong positivity in tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining for corticotropin (Panel E) is diffusely positive in tumor cells. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel F) shows tumor cells in lymphatic channels (arrowheads) at a distance from the main tumor mass.
