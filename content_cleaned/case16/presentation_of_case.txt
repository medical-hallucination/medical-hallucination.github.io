## Presentation of Case

Dr. Sally A. Ingham (Medicine): A 45-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and confusion.

The patient had been in her usual state of health until 18 months before the current admission, when her blood pressure was noted to be 140/90 mm Hg during a routine appointment with her primary care physician. Therapy with oral contraceptive pills was discontinued, but her blood pressure remained elevated when measured at home and during subsequent clinical evaluations. Results of duplex ultrasonography of the bilateral renal arterial vasculature were normal, as were levels of thyrotropin, plasma free catecholamines, plasma metanephrines, and aldosterone. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal ventricular function, with no evidence of valvular disease or left ventricular hypertrophy; the interventricular septal wall thickness was 11 mm (normal range, 7 to 11). Lisinopril was administered, and her blood pressure decreased to 120/80 mm Hg.

Four weeks before the current admission, swelling of the legs, abdominal distention, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported a weight gain of 4.5 kg during the previous month, occasional episodes of confusion, and two episodes of burning chest pain during exercise that had lasted for 2 minutes each and were relieved with rest. On examination, the temperature was 36.8Â°C, blood pressure 180/110 mm Hg, heart rate 73 beats per minute, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% while breathing ambient air. The weight was 66.9 kg; approximately 5 months earlier, at a clinic visit, it had been 67.1 kg. The body-mass index was 22. A systolic murmur (grade 2/6) was best heard at the left sternal border. The jugular venous pressure was estimated to be 10 cm of water. The abdomen was soft, nontender, and slightly distended. There was trace nonpitting edema in the legs.
