## Masses on Echocardiography

When interpreting the results of a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), it is often challenging to determine the origin of an intracardiac mass. The differential diagnosis typically includes vegetation, thrombus, and tumor. However, in this particular case, the masses were not intracardiac but external to the heart, located in the mediastinum. A mass in the anterior mediastinum is most commonly one of four types: thymoma, teratoma (germ-cell tumor), lymphoma, or thyroid tissue. The heart resides in the middle mediastinal compartment, where lymphadenopathy associated with lymphoma or lung cancer is the most common type of mass. This patient showed no clinical signs of these conditions. Another possibility is lymphadenopathy associated with sarcoidosis, which can cause syncope through arrhythmic or myocardial effects; however, imaging studies of the chest did not reveal any signs of lymphadenopathy. In this case, the lesions observed on the TTE do not appear to correspond with any of the typical extracardiac masses.
