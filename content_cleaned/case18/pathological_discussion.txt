## Pathological Discussion

Dr. James R. Stone: The saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm was removed surgically in two sections. On histologic examination of the specimens, the graft wall showed evidence of atherosclerosis and an organizing thrombus in the lumen. In the remaining medial layer of the graft, there was macrophage infiltration and scarring, with destruction of the elastic lamina. Saphenous-vein grafts often show scarring in the medial layer and atherosclerosis after one year. Case reports of the histologic features of saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm often note the scarring of the graft wall. There may also be macrophage-rich inflammatory infiltrates in saphenous-vein–graft aneurysm, similar to those seen in aneurysms at other sites in the body.
