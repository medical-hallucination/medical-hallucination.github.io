## Discussion of Management

Dr. Zachary S. Wallace discusses initial treatment considerations for a patient with polyarteritis nodosa, particularly in relation to HBV infection status and disease severity. The presence of ischemia, as indicated by testicular pain in this patient, classified the polyarteritis nodosa as severe. Despite the patient's remote history of HBV infection, HBV was not considered a driving factor in this case due to negative tests for HBV surface antigen, antibodies, and DNA, alongside normal liver function. Consequently, the condition was classified as idiopathic polyarteritis nodosa.

For severe idiopathic polyarteritis nodosa, remission is often pursued through glucocorticoids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Due to the rarity of this condition, there are limited data from large, randomized clinical trials to guide therapy choices. However, because of similarities to ANCA-associated vasculitis, some providers refer to findings from the Rituximab in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial, which demonstrated that rituximab is noninferior to cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated vasculitis treatment.

A trend in rheumatology is moving away from cyclophosphamide due to its unfavorable side effects, including potential cancer risks and bone marrow suppression. Given rituximab's safer profile, this patient received rituximab and high-dose glucocorticoids, with a plan to taper the dose over 12 months.

The risk of HBV reactivation following rituximab treatment varies with HBV infection status. Although the patient had previously tested positive for antibodies against the HBV core antigen, current tests were negative for HBV surface antigen and circulating HBV DNA, indicating no protective immunity from HBV surface antibodies and putting the patient at risk for potentially fatal HBV reactivation.

To mitigate HBV reactivation risks, HBV DNA levels can be monitored or prophylactic antiviral therapy administered, with tenofovir or entecavir as possible options; entecavir was selected here.

According to Dr. Keller, after beginning daily prednisone, the fever resolved. Rituximab, ivermectin, and entecavir were administered prior to discharge. The patient received more rituximab and reduced prednisone two weeks later. Although strongyloides antibodies tested positive, clinical evidence of strongyloidiasis was absent. One month later, the patient experienced hypertension, headaches, confusion, and seizures. An MRI showed posterior brain hyperintensity with mild leptomeningeal enhancement. A lumbar puncture produced normal results, and antiepileptic and antihypertensive treatments were given. Follow-up MRI imaging showed improvement.

The patient was diagnosed with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, potentially related to rituximab treatment, leading to a decision against further rituximab administration. Given stabilization with prednisone, the therapy continued with close monitoring for recurrence. Prednisone was continued for about a year, with CD20+ B lymphocytes remaining depleted post-rituximab therapy. The ongoing entecavir prophylaxis is planned to cease six months after CD20+ B lymphocytes repopulate, with no polyarteritis nodosa recurrence noted.
