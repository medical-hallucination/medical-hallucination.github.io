## Infection

A thorough evaluation ruled out most potential infectious causes for this patient's condition. The common causes of epididymo-orchitis include sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, particularly among younger individuals, and infections with *Escherichia coli* and other colonic bacteria that can be transmitted through anal intercourse or due to ascending urethritis, especially in older individuals with benign prostatic hypertrophy. In this case, nucleic acid amplification tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia DNA were negative, a urinalysis showed no white cells, and a urine culture did not grow any bacteria, making these diagnoses unlikely.

Brucellosis, a zoonotic infection acquired through contact with infected animals or contaminated food, can cause epididymitis, orchitis, or testicular abscesses in 2 to 20% of cases in men. However, this patient had no relevant exposures. Moreover, in a case series, 69% of patients with brucellosis and testicular symptoms had positive blood cultures, while this patient had negative blood cultures and negative tests for brucella-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, effectively ruling out this diagnosis. Mumps should also be considered, especially given the unknown vaccination status. However, this patient had no swelling of the parotid gland, which usually comes before orchitis, no known exposures, and a negative test for mumps-specific IgM antibodies.

Tuberculosis requires particular consideration given the patient's previous infection and current systemic illness. While tuberculosis can affect the testicle, causing either painful or painless swelling, evaluation for reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis has been unrevealing. Despite the testicle seeming like an unlikely primary site for extrapulmonary infection, excluding tuberculosis as a possible syndrome without thorough investigation is premature. A testicular biopsy, including a mycobacterial smear, culture, and histological examination, would be essential for confirming or ruling out this possibility.
