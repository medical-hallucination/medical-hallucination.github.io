## Presentation of Case

Dr. Jaime L. Schneider (Medicine): A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital with a 2-week history of fever, chills, arthralgias, abdominal and testicular pain, and leukocytosis.

Twenty-five years before the current admission, while the patient was living in China, he received a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. At that time, he completed a 14-month course of a four-drug regimen for tuberculosis (with unknown medications). Although treatment was completed, a chronic cough that produced scant white sputum persisted. Two years later, the patient immigrated to the United States, and examination of an induced sputum sample for *Mycobacterium* tuberculosis was reportedly negative.

The patient also had a history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; 12 years before the current admission, he had a positive test for HBV surface antigen. At that time, a nucleic acid amplification test for HBV DNA was negative. Thereafter, annual surveillance for cancer was performed with abdominal ultrasonography and measurement of the blood alpha-fetoprotein level. An elevated alpha-fetoprotein level was never detected. Ultrasonography was notable for the presence of simple hepatic and renal cysts and heterogeneous hepatic echotexture, but follow-up examination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver revealed no signal abnormality.

Three years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated for chronic cough. Radiography of the chest revealed a nodular opacity at the apex of the right lung. Follow-up examination with computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a calcified granuloma at the right apex and evidence of bronchiectasis, and plans were made for annual surveillance with CT.

Fourteen days before the current admission, anorexia and fatigue developed, along with pain and tightness in the back and calves. Six days later, the patient was seen by his primary care physician at this hospital. He reported no antecedent trauma. The temperature was 37.0°C. There was tenderness in the bilateral lumbar paraspinal muscles. Results of a neurologic examination — including tests of motor strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait — were normal. Radiography of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative disk disease that was most pronounced at the L4 to L5 level, with preserved vertebral-body height. Ibuprofen was prescribed.

Later that day, the temperature reached 38.9°C. Fever, chills, sweats, and rigors persisted and were associated with myalgias of the back and calves that were severe enough to impair walking. Ibuprofen provided only temporary relief of the fever and myalgias. The patient visited a traditional Chinese doctor, who performed moxibustion (i.e., the application of burning dried mugwort directly to the body) and administered a cathartic agent, which had no effect. Left testicular pain and swelling developed, and the patient returned to his primary care physician 5 days after the previous visit. He reported no dysuria, hematuria, lymphadenopathy, headache, nuchal rigidity, or rash. The examination was notable for a temperature of 37.8°C shortly after the administration of ibuprofen, the presence of moxibustion marks on the upper back, and a swollen, tender area on the upper lateral aspect of the left testicle. Screening tests for Lyme disease and nucleic acid amplification tests for Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma DNA were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood and urine cultures and imaging studies were performed.

Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: On ultrasonography of the scrotum, both testes had normal echotexture and normal Doppler flow, with no focal lesions. Bilateral subcentimeter epididymal cysts were identified. Radiography of the chest revealed a nodular opacity at the apex of the right lung, which had not changed from previous studies and was most likely related to previous granulomatous disease. There were new ill-defined opacities at the lung bases that, in the appropriate clinical context, could reflect multifocal pneumonia.

Dr. Schneider: A 7-day course of levofloxacin was prescribed. Fever recurred (with a temperature of up to 39.0°C) and was associated with chills, rigors, anorexia, myalgias, and arthralgias. These symptoms persisted for the next 3 days, and the myalgias and arthralgias appeared to worsen when the temperature was highest. The patient also had intermittent sharp abdominal pain, two episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, and a weight loss of 1 kg. His primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of this hospital.

Additional patient history was obtained in the emergency department. The patient reported brief, sharp, stabbing chest pain that was not related to exertion, as well as a chronic cough that produced thin, white sputum. He also noted that blurry vision had developed in the left eye 2 days earlier, with no vision loss. He had pruritus and tinea cruris. A review of systems was negative for headache, jaw claudication, other rashes, and joint pain. No sick contacts were reported.

Medications included levofloxacin, aspirin, nystatin powder, and triamcinolone cream. The use of tamsulosin had caused nasal discharge. The patient had smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day for more than 40 years, but he did not use illicit drugs. He drank one glass of wine per night, although he had previously consumed up to two drinks of whiskey daily. The patient had retired from restaurant work 2 years earlier, and his last international trip had been to China 3 years earlier. His father died from lung cancer at 71 years of age, and his mother died at 39 years of age from an unknown cause. The patient had six siblings, a son who had a hemangioma, and a daughter who had an irregular heartbeat. There was no family history of pulmonary, ocular, infectious, or rheumatologic diseases.

On examination, the temperature was 37.8°C and then rose to 38.3°C, the blood pressure 126/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert, and he appeared somewhat fatigued. The eyes had no scleral icterus, and the oropharynx had no erythema, exudates, or ulcerations. The neck was supple, with a normal range of motion, and the spine and paraspinal muscles were nontender. There was no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Auscultation revealed faint rales at the lung bases and scattered bilateral rhonchi and wheezes, with no cardiac murmur or rub. The bowel sounds were normal, and the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with no rebound, guarding, or hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash, joint deformity, erythema, warmth, swelling, effusion, or tenderness. The joints had full range of motion. The stool was guaiac-negative. Motor strength was normal and symmetric in the arms and legs, and distal pulses were intact.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.*

Dr. Kilcoyne: Radiography of the chest revealed persistent opacities at the lung bases and right apex. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mildly increased enhancement of the gallbladder wall, as well as pericholecystic fluid. These findings are nonspecific; in the absence of gallstones, they could occur in the context of volume overload or as manifestations of a systemic condition, such as chronic liver disease. Scattered subcentimeter hypodensities were present in the liver that most likely represented simple cysts. Bilateral small pleural effusions and trace peritoneal fluid were present. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed thickening of the gallbladder wall, along with gallbladder sludge. Sonographic Murphy's sign was negative.

Dr. Schneider: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Levofloxacin was discontinued, and acetaminophen and one dose of doxycycline were administered. Over the next 6 days, the patient remained febrile, with a temperature ranging from 38.1 to 39.6°C. Additional tests were performed. Hepatobiliary radionuclide scanning revealed patent cystic and common bile ducts, with no evidence of acute cholecystitis. 

Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed only mild cataracts and dry eyes, with no evidence of an eye infection or retinopathy.

Dr. Kilcoyne: Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, performed on the fifth hospital day, revealed bilateral pleural effusions that were larger than they had been on the day of admission. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine revealed no evidence of diskitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscesses. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the liver revealed scattered subcentimeter simple hepatic cysts. Thoracentesis was performed on the right side with the use of ultrasonographic guidance.

Dr. Schneider: The pleural fluid was consistent with a transudative effusion. A test of the pleural fluid for adenosine deaminase was negative, as was a Gram's stain and an acid-fast smear; cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were performed. Cytologic examination of the urine, which was performed because of the history of smoking and microscopic hematuria, revealed no malignant cells. Transthoracic echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography revealed no valvular vegetation.

On the seventh hospital day, swelling, pain, and tenderness recurred in the left scrotum. The temperature reached 40.1°C. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood and 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field.

Dr. Kilcoyne: Follow-up ultrasonography of the scrotum, performed 10 days after the first ultrasound study had been obtained, revealed new engorgement of testicular vessels that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Both testes were heterogeneous in echotexture. The findings were suggestive of epididymo-orchitis.
