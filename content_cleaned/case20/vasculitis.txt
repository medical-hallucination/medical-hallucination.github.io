## Vasculitis

Since infectious and mechanical causes have been largely ruled out and the patient had evidence of engorged vessels on imaging studies, vasculitis rises to the top of the differential diagnosis. In evaluating suspected vasculitis, determining the size of the involved vessels (large, medium, or small) based on features of the clinical presentation is a useful initial step. Anchoring on the involvement of the testicular vasculature allows ruling out large-vessel vasculitis, as the testicular vessels are not large branches of the aorta. If I had chosen a different anchor, such as the presence of vision changes, systemic symptoms, and elevated inflammatory markers in an older man, I may have considered giant-cell arteritis more closely. However, I am using the testicular symptoms as a starting point, thereby lowering the likelihood of giant-cell arteritis from the outset.

When testicular involvement occurs as a manifestation of systemic vasculitis in adults, it is most commonly associated with polyarteritis nodosa (a medium-vessel vasculitis). However, testicular symptoms can also occur with various types of small-vessel vasculitis. For example, IgA vasculitis (a small-vessel vasculitis) can cause testicular pain and swelling, and such testicular involvement may be more common in children than in adults. However, palpable purpura is a characteristic feature of IgA vasculitis. In one case series involving adult patients, purpura affected 96% of the patients. Since this patient did not have purpura, a diagnosis of IgA vasculitis is unlikely.

Because testicular involvement has been reported with polyarteritis nodosa and various types of small-vessel vasculitis, I will now consider other differentiating features of this case that may help narrow the differential diagnosis. Laboratory tests can help differentiate between types of small-vessel vasculitis. For instance, when serum cryoglobulins, rheumatoid factor antibodies, and a low C4 level are not detected in a patient without characteristic purpura, a diagnosis of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is unlikely. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)â€“associated vasculitis typically affects small vessels, but ANCA testing was negative in this patient. Of note, the sensitivity of ANCA testing depends on the organ systems involved. Assuming the mildly elevated creatinine level and microscopic hematuria indicated vasculitis with renal involvement, the sensitivity would be greater than 90% for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and roughly 70% for microscopic polyangiitis. Hence, the negative ANCA testing makes these diagnoses unlikely. The sensitivity of ANCA testing for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is only about 50%, so a negative test does not rule out this diagnosis.

Are there any features of this patient's presentation that can help differentiate between medium-vessel vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa) and small-vessel vasculitis? Characterizing the extent of pulmonary involvement may become a crucial point that narrows the differential diagnosis. Involvement of the lung parenchyma suggests small-vessel vasculitis, as inflammation of the capillaries can result in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. In contrast, in polyarteritis nodosa, the capillaries are unaffected and the parenchyma is spared. Initially, there was some clinical concern about pneumonia, and the patient was treated with antibiotics. However, after reviewing the imaging studies in the context of the clinical syndrome, the nodules were stable, and there were no new infiltrates or features consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The known previous granulomatous disease sufficiently explains the presence of the nodules, and the stability of both the imaging findings and pulmonary symptoms suggests the lungs were not affected by the current process. Therefore, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Goodpasture's syndrome, which tends to involve the lungs and kidneys, are unlikely. With active lung involvement ruled out, the most likely diagnosis in this case is polyarteritis nodosa, which seems to fit this patient's clinical syndrome.

According to the clinical features of polyarteritis nodosa from a case series involving 348 patients, this patient's presentation with multiorgan involvement is consistent with the diagnosis. Polyarteritis nodosa can be associated with HBV infection or be idiopathic. HBV-associated polyarteritis nodosa is attributed to immune-complex deposition during active viremia. Although this patient had a remote history of HBV infection, HBV DNA was not detected at this presentation; thus, HBV is unlikely to be the cause.

To establish a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in this patient, I recommend performing a biopsy of the left testicle. Immunosuppression treatment would probably be initiated quickly if a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is confirmed on biopsy. Additional testing and treatment before the initiation of immunosuppression could be vital. Since the previous HBV infection puts the patient at risk of viral reactivation, viral prophylaxis may be considered. Given the fluctuating eosinophilia, which remains unexplained by the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa, and the history of emigration from a region where strongyloides is present, the patient is at risk of quiescent infection and empirical treatment may be administered, especially if serologic testing results are unavailable before the initiation of immunosuppression.
