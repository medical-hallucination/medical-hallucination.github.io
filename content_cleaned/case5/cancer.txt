## Cancer

Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis or lymphomatosis is a diagnostic consideration in this patient. Spinal and cranial nerve roots may be damaged as they pass through diseased meninges. However, this syndrome is rarely part of the initial presentation of cancer, and this patient did not have other signs or symptoms suggestive of advanced cancer. In addition, she did not have findings suggestive of leptomeningeal disease on MRI. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or meningeal biopsy would be necessary to rule out this diagnosis, I suspect that other possible causes of her illness are more likely.
