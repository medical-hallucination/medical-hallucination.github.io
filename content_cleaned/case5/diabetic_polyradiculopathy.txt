## Diabetic Polyradiculopathy

Several disorders can cause or mimic subacute polyradiculopathy or polyradiculoneuropathy with potentially normal spine imaging findings, as described in this patient. Diabetic thoracic polyradiculopathy, the pathophysiological equivalent of diabetic cervical or lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, is among the most common of these disorders. Approximately one-quarter of acute-to-subacute thoracic polyradiculopathy cases coincide with a new diabetes mellitus diagnosis, aligning with this patient's newly discovered elevated blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. However, patients with diabetic polyradiculopathy often have a prodrome of constitutional symptoms, including weight loss and malaise, along with symptoms of autonomic failure, which were not observed in this patient. Moreover, diabetic radiculopathy symptoms are usually bilateral, asymmetric, and confined to a single segment (cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral). Thus, diabetic thoracic polyradiculopathy seems unlikely in this case.
