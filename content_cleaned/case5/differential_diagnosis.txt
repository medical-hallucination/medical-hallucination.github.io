## Differential Diagnosis

Dr. Haatem M. Reda: The first step in evaluating a patient with a potential neurologic problem is to define the syndromeâ€”combining the neuroanatomical localization and temporal profile. Over a 10-week period, this patient experienced back pain followed by weakness in the muscles of the abdominal and thoracic walls, reduced truncal sensation involving the genitals, multifocal areflexic weakness in the arms and legs, and probable urinary overflow incontinence. Localization of the process allows us to develop an initial differential diagnosis to logically narrow down the possibilities.
