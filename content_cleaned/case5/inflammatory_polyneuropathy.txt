## Inflammatory Polyneuropathy

Another important consideration in this patient is multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor neuropathy (MADSAM), a variant of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, which causes pain, multifocal sensory loss, and areflexic weakness in a radicular or peripheral-nerve distribution. MADSAM most commonly involves long nerves, although cranial nerves may also be affected. However, this patient's predominantly truncal presentation would be unusual with this diagnosis.
