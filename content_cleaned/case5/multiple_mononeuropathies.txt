## Multiple Mononeuropathies

Although the syndrome of multiple mononeuropathies (mononeuritis multiplex) is not a polyradiculopathy, it must be considered in this patient with painful, multifocal sensory loss, given the importance of early recognition of an underlying systemic or peripheral nervous system vasculitis. However, in patients with multiple mononeuropathies, symptoms develop in a haphazard peripheral-nerve distribution, and this patient's symptoms were more radicular. Additionally, this patient had predominantly truncal symptoms, which would be unusual in multiple mononeuropathies, because it most often affects the long nerves in the arms and legs, given their relatively high susceptibility to vasculitis-associated ischemia.
