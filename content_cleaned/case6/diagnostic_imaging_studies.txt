## Diagnostic Imaging Studies

Dr. Rajiv Gupta: The diagnostic test in this case was an MRI of the head. T1-weighted images obtained before the intravenous administration of contrast showed hypointense lesions in the central splenium of the corpus callosum. These lesions were hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and had contrast enhancement on post-contrast imaging. Multiple lesions in the subcortical white matter bilaterally were observed to be hyperintense on FLAIR imaging and many showed contrast enhancement. There was an absence of mass effect associated with these lesions, but there were foci of leptomeningeal enhancement and gray-matter enhancement, including a focus in the right thalamus. Additionally, the corona radiata showed diffuse perivascular parenchymal enhancement. Many lesions appeared hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images and hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient images. Magnetic resonance angiography results of the head and neck were normal.

**Figure 3. MRI of the Head.**  
A T1-weighted image shows hypointense lesions in the central splenium of the corpus callosum (Panel A, arrow). These lesions display hyperintensity on a FLAIR image (Panel B, arrows) and contrast enhancement on a post-contrast image (Panel C, arrows). Multiple subcortical white matter lesions bilaterally are hyperintense on FLAIR imaging and show enhancement. No associated mass effect is observed. Leptomeningeal enhancement is shown (Panel D, arrow), and gray-matter enhancement includes a focus in the right thalamus (Panel E, arrow). The corona radiata displays diffuse perivascular parenchymal enhancement (Panel F, arrows). Many lesions exhibit hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (Panel G, arrows) and hypointensity on apparent-diffusion-coefficient imaging (Panel H, arrows).

The presence of multiple white-matter lesions could suggest conditions like multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. However, the presence of leptomeningeal and gray-matter lesions rules out these being purely white-matter processes. The morphology of the lesions in the corpus callosum, central rather than peripheral, is atypical of multiple sclerosis. Their distribution makes lymphoma and neurosarcoidosis unlikely, and lymphoma usually shows more avid enhancement and mass effect.

Multifocal supratentorial white-matter lesions involving the central corpus callosum are characteristic of Susac's syndrome. In this patient, they display a pattern described as resembling a "string of pearls." Susac's syndrome may involve the deep gray matter (in 70% of cases), parenchymal enhancement (70%), and leptomeningeal enhancement (33%). These MRI findings, combined with ophthalmologic findings, are diagnostic of Susac's syndrome.
