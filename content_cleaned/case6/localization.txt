## Localization

The afferent visual system extends across a significant portion of the nervous system, starting from the tear film and cornea and continuing through the anterior chamber, crystalline lens, vitreous humor, retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, optic radiation, and striate cortex in the occipital lobe. It also includes specialized extrastriate areas in the parietal and temporal lobes. The patient in question reports vision loss in her right eye, although it is common for patients to mistakenly perceive homonymous vision loss as affecting just one eye. This distinction is important for localization: vision loss affecting the same side of the visual field in both eyes localizes to the retrochiasmal pathway, involving the optic tract, optic radiation, and occipital cortex, while deficits confined to one eye localize to the ocular media, retina, or optic nerve on that side.

In this particular case, the history and examination findings confirm vision loss localized to the right eye. Disorders of the cornea, lens, or vitreous usually do not cause the type of discrete scotoma described by this patient. Thus, the vision loss likely localizes to the optic nerve or retina. Distinguishing between these is critical, as disorders affecting these structures differ significantly, influencing management and prognosis.
