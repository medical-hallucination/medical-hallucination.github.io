## Discussion of Initial Management — Trauma Surgery Perspective

Dr. Peter T. Masiakos: This patient presented with a high-velocity, close-range gunshot wound to the face, resulting in massive soft tissue destruction. Complex fracture patterns and associated oral and ocular trauma made this type of injury quite dramatic. However, if the trajectory of the bullet does not involve the brain, the injury is typically nonlethal, which was the case here.

While there is substantial literature on the reconstruction of facial gunshot injuries, there is limited data on the initial evaluation and surgical interventions necessary for such injuries. The patient survived the immediate trauma and was transported to a local facility where emergency treatment followed conventional approaches and advanced trauma life support protocols.

The most frequent and life-threatening problem in the trauma unit, airway compromise, was first addressed. The patient was awake and could breathe without support, but due to concerns about potential bleeding and swelling of the oropharynx, a cricothyroidotomy was performed to ensure continued airway control. The patient was then transferred to a tertiary care hospital, where his injuries were further assessed, and the cricothyroidotomy was subsequently converted to a formal surgical tracheotomy.

Urgent control of bleeding is often needed for gunshot wounds to the face, particularly in patients with hemodynamic instability due to blood loss from vessels at the base of the skull. In most cases, local surgical control or nasal/oropharyngeal packing effectively stops bleeding. For some patients, 10% may require angioembolization to control deeper vessel hemorrhages. This patient did not have massive bleeding, and urgent control was unnecessary. Slow and persistent blood loss from the oropharynx was managed using oropharyngeal packing.

Once the airway was secured and bleeding controlled, the patient was transferred to this hospital for specialized care from ophthalmology and facial plastic surgery services. Due to ocular involvement, an urgent ophthalmologic evaluation was performed. Over the next several weeks, the patient underwent multiple operations, including débridement of necrotic soft tissue, addressing a CSF leak, internal fixation of maxillofacial bones, skin wound coverage, and placement of a gastrostomy feeding tube. The timing of reconstruction procedures is determined by the extent of injury and soft-tissue loss, but outcomes for early and delayed reconstructions appear similar. Surgical repair and wound covering decisions are primarily based on the patient's hemodynamic stability.
