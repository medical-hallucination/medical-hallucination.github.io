## Lethal Means

Whether a suicide attempt results in death is directly related to the means used to commit the act. In the United States, suicide is linked with gun violence and accounts for nearly two-thirds of all firearm-related deaths; approximately half of suicides are completed with guns. Access to a firearm is a risk factor for suicide; the odds of death by suicide among those with access to a gun are more than three times as high as among those who do not. Despite the outcome in this case, people who attempt suicide with a firearm rarely get a second chance, with a fatality rate of approximately 85%, compared with a rate of around 2% among those who attempt suicide by poisoning or overdose. It is often assumed that a suicide attempt with a gun indicates a more determined or serious attempt. However, after the patient in this case survived, he did not express a consistent desire to end his life but rather a desire to engage in treatment and live.
