## Mental Health

This patient had no known history of depression or other mental illness. However, data from 27 states suggest that 54% of people who died by suicide in 2015 had no known history of mental illness. This raises two possibilities: many people might be living with undiagnosed mental illnesses, or that depression or other mental illnesses may not be the only driving forces leading to suicide. Both statements are likely true.

Evidence suggests that suicide can sometimes be an impulsive act rather than a long-reasoned decision. For example, in a study of patients who survived a suicide attempt, nearly half reported that the time between the first thought of suicide and the attempt was 10 minutes or less. Therefore, factors that increase impulsivity could be crucial in the complex act of attempting suicide. This patient, who had stress at work and in his marriage, also had a risk factor associated with increased impulsivity: substance use. He was found to have a markedly elevated blood ethanol level, and although the urine toxicology screen results were not confirmed, the screen was presumptively positive for methamphetamine.
