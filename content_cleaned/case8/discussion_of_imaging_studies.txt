## Discussion of Imaging Studies

Dr. Aoife Kilcoyne: MRI of the pelvis, performed before and after the administration of contrast material, revealed a vagina that was normal in length. No discernible uterus or cervix was identified. Cordlike structures, best seen on the contrast-enhanced images, extended from the superior aspect of the vagina to the right and left inguinal canals, following the expected course of the round ligaments of the uterus. These structures became symmetrically dilated near the deep inguinal ring. On T2-weighted imaging, there were bilateral thin, linear, hyperintense tubelike structures along the course of the round ligaments, likely representing isthmic and interstitial segments of the fallopian tubes or lymphatic vessels. Right and left gonads were identified in the anterior pelvis alongside the tubelike structures. No definite follicles were seen. Some gonadal tissue followed the course of the round ligaments into the inguinal canals. There were no gonadal masses.
