## Discussion of Infertility Management and Follow-Up

Dr. Mary E. Sabatini: Because infertility involves both partners, we encourage each partner to sign a form for the release of information to allow providers to share one partner's medical findings with the other. However, permission to share information does not mean that everything is automatically disclosed. In this case, due to potential distress from the patient's chromosomal makeup differing from the gender with which she identified, all test results, including the karyotype, were relayed to the patient without her spouse present. It was explained that the development of a female phenotype in the context of a male karyotype occurs due to a mutation in the androgen receptor that makes it nonfunctional.

At initial presentation, the patient and her husband met with a social worker due to the need for third-party reproduction with an oocyte donor and a gestational carrier, per American Society of Reproductive Medicine guidelines. The same social worker was available when the karyotype was disclosed, and the physician and social worker addressed the psychosocial aspects of this disorder of sexual development and its implications for the patient's marriage.

Given that 70% of androgen insensitivity syndrome cases are inherited, we discussed potential ramifications for her family, especially her two sisters.

Initially, the patient decided not to disclose her diagnosis to her husband or family but ultimately reversed this decision. She chose not to undergo testing to determine her specific androgen-receptor mutation. Her sisters have not attempted pregnancy yet and thus have not pursued genetic testing. The patient and her husband conceived with an oocyte donor and a gestational carrier, and a singleton intrauterine pregnancy is ongoing.
