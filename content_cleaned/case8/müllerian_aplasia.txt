## Müllerian Aplasia

Patients with müllerian aplasia, known as the Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome, have an XX genotype. They lack derivatives of the müllerian ducts, including the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina, but possess ovaries and undergo puberty with normal breast development and growth of axillary and pubic hair. These patients are endocrinologically typical females with normal female external genitalia at birth but experience amenorrhea due to the absence of a uterus. Some cases have specific gene deletions or sporadic mutations. In the most common type, müllerian aplasia type 1, only the reproductive organs are affected. Type 2 is associated with abnormalities in other body parts, like the kidneys or skeleton. Müllerian aplasia is a plausible diagnosis because it explains the absence of a uterus and cervix in a patient with normal female external genitalia and development.
