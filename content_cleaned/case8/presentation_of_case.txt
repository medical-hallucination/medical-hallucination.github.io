## Presentation of Case

Dr. Caitlin Sacha (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 31-year-old woman with infertility was referred to the fertility center of this hospital by a surrogate parenting agency to discuss the possibility of family building with an oocyte donor and a gestational carrier.

The patient reported that, at 16 years of age, she had been evaluated for primary amenorrhea and diagnosed with congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries. At approximately 12 years, adrenarche and thelarche had occurred alongside a linear growth spurt. She had never experienced menstrual molimina, headaches, vision problems, galactorrhea, vasomotor symptoms, or a reduction in exercise tolerance.

When she was 10 years old, she fractured her arm and underwent a tonsillectomy. She took no medications and had no known allergies. Four months before the current evaluation, she had moved to New England from northern Europe; she lived with her husband in a suburban area and worked in an office. She rarely drank alcohol, smoked 3 to 5 cigarettes a day, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had easily conceived her children and had a hysterectomy because of endometriosis at 46 years of age; her maternal grandfather died of a myocardial infarction at 70 years. Her father and two sisters were healthy; one sister, her fraternal twin, had regular menses.

On examination, her blood pressure was 118/74 mm Hg, weight 68.1 kg, height 172.7 cm, and body-mass index 22.8. She had minimal body hair. A pelvic examination revealed normal female external genitalia and normal vaginal length and rugae, with no abnormal discharge or evidence of pelvic-organ prolapse. The cervix and uterus were absent. Mild fullness was noted in the left adnexal region without tenderness or a discrete mass. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

Ultrasonography of the pelvis confirmed the absence of the uterus and cervix. The right ovary was not visualized; there were clusters of simple cysts in the adnexal region on the right side, with one measuring 24 mm by 25 mm and another 18 mm by 17 mm, and on the left side, with one measuring 18 mm by 17 mm and another 20 mm by 21 mm. The tests were positive for rubella virus IgG antibodies and varicella–zoster virus IgG antibodies, and screening tests were negative for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis C virus, human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2, syphilis, and cytomegalovirus. The complete blood count and differential count were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Blood specimens were collected for measurement of the antimüllerian hormone level and chromosomal analysis.

Five days later, additional diagnostic tests were performed, as shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessed bone mineral density, revealing borderline low bone mass in the spine on posterior–anterior examination (T score, −1.10), normal bone mass in the vertebral bodies on lateral examination (T score, −0.20), and normal bone mass in the femoral neck (T score, −0.90).

Four days later, a diagnostic test result was received, and management decisions were made.
