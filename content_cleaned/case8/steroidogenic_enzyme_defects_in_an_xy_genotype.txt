## Steroidogenic Enzyme Defects in an XY Genotype

Defects of enzymes involved in early steroidogenesis in the context of an XY genotype may result in a clinical phenotype similar to the one seen in the patient. In cases of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, androstenedione (a weak androgen) is synthesized, but testosterone is not. Consequently, the fetus is not exposed to potent androgens, and typical male genital differentiation does not occur. However, individuals with this deficiency often experience virilization during puberty if the testes remain intact, which was not observed in this case.

A deficiency in the P450c17 enzyme complex, which is responsible for both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activity, would lead to profound fetal androgen deficiency. Patients with this condition present with female external genitalia at birth, as did the patient. However, such patients would typically experience an adrenal crisis early in life due to impaired glucocorticoid synthesis. Milder forms of P450c17 deficiency can cause delayed puberty, hypokalemia, and hypertension. Given the lack of relevant clinical characteristics in this patient, these steroidogenic enzyme defects can be ruled out.
