## Summary

Based on the history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is either m√ºllerian aplasia or complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. A review of the laboratory data shows a low level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on two separate measurements despite an elevated luteinizing hormone level. This pattern of gonadotropin secretion is not typically observed in females with a normal menstrual cycle. In the case of premature ovarian insufficiency, the FSH level would be elevated, surpassing the luteinizing hormone level, and both would be at menopausal levels. However, the low FSH level aligns with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Unlike luteinizing hormone regulation, which relies solely on gonadal steroid feedback, FSH regulation depends on feedback from both gonadal steroids and inhibin. In complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, low circulating estrogens lead to minimal negative feedback, and high androgen levels (especially testosterone) do not inhibit gonadotropins, due to the lack of a functional androgen receptor in the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Sertoli cells secrete significant amounts of inhibin B, selectively inhibiting FSH secretion by gonadotropic cells. Given the suppressed FSH level, the patient may have hypersecretion of inhibin B, possibly from a tumor. The fullness observed on the left side during the pelvic examination might indicate a testicular tumor. Generally, gonadal tumors associated with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are germ-cell tumors, such as gonadoblastoma, dysgerminoma, or seminoma. Additionally, Sertoli-cell adenomas and tumors of the Sertoli and Leydig cells are common. MRI would be useful for confirming the presence of testes and evaluating for a potential tumor in this patient.
