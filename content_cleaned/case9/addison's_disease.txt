## Addison's Disease

Addison's disease typically presents with fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Symptoms may also include hypotension and fever during an adrenal crisis. Eosinophilia, if present, tends to be mild, with eosinophil counts rarely surpassing 1000 per cubic millimeter. This patient's symptoms, such as fever and fatigue, were partially suggestive of Addison's disease, but the clinical presentation overall did not align with this diagnosis, particularly given the higher than expected eosinophil levels.
