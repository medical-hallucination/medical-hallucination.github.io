## Allergy

In regions not heavily burdened by parasites, allergic reactions to drugs are the most common cause of eosinophilia. Drug-induced eosinophilia can vary from asymptomatic reactions to those involving significant end-organ involvement, such as in the DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome. Symptoms of DRESS usually appear 2 to 8 weeks after starting a new drug, with many implicated medications, including proton-pump inhibitors and statins, which this patient had been using for years.

The European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (RegiSCAR) offers a scoring system to gauge the likelihood of DRESS syndrome, under which this patient fits the criteria for definite DRESS. Though this aligns with the clinical manifestations, the cause for DRESS is not clear because omeprazole and rosuvastatin were not newly introduced drugs for this patient. He had begun taking new pain medications around 5 weeks before admission, but specific details of these medications remain unknown, complicating their direct association with his illness. A thorough reevaluation of case specifics is required to identify any possible triggers for DRESS syndrome.
