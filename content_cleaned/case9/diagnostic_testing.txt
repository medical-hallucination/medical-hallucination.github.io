## Diagnostic Testing

Dr. Eng: The diagnostic test, a quantitative real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay of the peripheral blood for HHV-6, was performed 2 days after admission, approximately 3 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms. The test was positive, at a viral load of 112,836 copies per milliliter (reference range, <500). Two weeks after the initial testing, the viral load decreased to less than 500 copies per milliliter. The absolute viral load and its rapid decrease helped rule out the possibility of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 as the cause of the elevated viral load. Notably, HHV-6 can integrate into the human genome, occurring in approximately 1% of the general population. Once integrated, very high viral loads (often >1 million copies per milliliter) can be detected in the blood but do not necessarily indicate active infection.

Serum HHV-6 IgM and IgG antibody titers were obtained as well. The IgM antibody titer was elevated, at higher than 1:320 (reference range, <1:20), and the IgG antibody titer was elevated, at higher than 1:10,240 (reference range, <1:10). These findings further support the diagnosis of HHV-6 infection. Elevated IgM and IgG antibody titers can indicate acute HHV-6 seroconversion or reactivation. Results from a previous HHV-6 serologic panel would be required to distinguish between these scenarios definitively. Overall, these test results support the diagnosis of an HHV-6 mononucleosis-like illness associated with the DRESS syndrome.
