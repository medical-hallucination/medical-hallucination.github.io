## Reevaluation Of The Clinical Presentation

Other salient features of this patient's clinical presentation include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and atypical lymphocytosis. Although pharyngitis was not reported, the constellation of findings is consistent with a mononucleosis-like syndrome. The differential diagnosis for a mononucleosis-like syndrome includes acute infection with Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), HIV, toxoplasma, or adenovirus. Acute HIV infection, toxoplasmosis, and adenovirus infection may cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome; however, aspects of the case make each of these diagnoses unlikely. This patient had negative screening tests for HIV infection and an undetectable plasma HIV RNA level, findings that rule out the diagnosis of acute HIV infection. Acute toxoplasmosis is characterized by fever and lymphadenopathy; however, this patient did not report any exposure to cats or ingestion of undercooked meat that could have resulted in infection. Adenovirus infection is also unlikely, because this patient did not have respiratory or ocular symptoms, which are common features of this illness.

Acute EBV and CMV infections are consistent with this patient's presentation, and contact with a sick young child provides an appropriate risk of exposure to infection. The weakly positive heterophile antibody test is also supportive of one of these diagnoses, since EBV and CMV can each cause a positive heterophile reaction. Features of this case that are not consistent with these infections include the results of EBV-specific serologic tests, which suggested a past infection rather than a current infection, and the negative CMV antigenemia assay, which indicated the absence of viremia, a classic feature of acute CMV infection. In view of these findings, these infections are unlikely to be the trigger of the patient's symptoms.
