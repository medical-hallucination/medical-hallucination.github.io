Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
One Year Before Presentation:

Patient experienced transient tightness in left chest and shoulder
Was referred to outpatient physical therapy

5 Days Before Presentation:

Developed acute substernal chest pain while packing for Boston flight
Pain radiated to jaw and shoulders
Had dyspnea and feeling of needing to belch
Symptoms lasted 1 hour then resolved spontaneously
Patient attributed symptoms to fatigue

1 Day Before Presentation:

Chest pain recurred after walking
Pain radiated to jaw and shoulders
Gradually resolved after a few hours

Day of Presentation:

Chest pain recurred before dinner
Associated with lightheadedness
Attended dinner despite persistent pain and dyspnea
Presented to emergency department
Initial troponin T: 0.03 ng/dl
ECG showed ST-segment depressions
Given aspirin, atorvastatin, and IV heparin
Underwent coronary angiography showing coronary artery dissection

3 Hours After Presentation:

ECG showed decreased ST-segment depressions

8 Hours After Presentation:

ECG showed complete resolution of ST changes
Troponin T increased to 0.21 ng/dl

6 Weeks After Presentation:

Follow-up treadmill stress test
Able to exercise for 9 minutes
No diagnostic ECG changes
No chest pain

After Follow-up:

Experienced fleeting episodes of intermittent chest pain
No prolonged episodes
Continued daily exercise
Maintained on low-dose beta-blocker, aspirin, and isosorbide mononitrate

The pattern shows progressively worsening symptoms over 5 days, culminating in persistent pain requiring emergency care. Treatment led to improvement, though some residual symptoms remained. The case illustrates the typical presentation of spontaneous coronary artery dissection, with symptoms initially coming and going before becoming more persistent.
