Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case.

1 Year Before Presentation:
- Patient experienced transient tightness in left chest and shoulder
- Was referred to outpatient physical therapy

5 Days Before Presentation:
- While packing for Boston flight, developed acute substernal chest pain
- Symptoms included:
  - Radiation to jaw and shoulders
  - Dyspnea
  - Feeling of needing to belch
- Duration: 1 hour, resolved spontaneously
- Patient attributed to fatigue

1 Day Before Presentation:
- Chest pain recurred after walking
- Pain radiated to jaw and shoulders
- Gradually resolved after a few hours

Day of Presentation:
- Before dinner: Pain recurred with light-headedness
- During dinner: Pain persisted with dyspnea
- After dinner: Presented to emergency department
- At ED:
  - Found to be diaphoretic
  - ECG showed ST-segment depressions in V3, V4, and V5
  - 3 hours later: ST depressions decreased
  - 8 hours later: ST changes fully resolved
  - Treatments initiated:
    - Aspirin
    - Atorvastatin
    - Intravenous heparin

A clear pattern emerges of escalating symptoms: from transient symptoms a year ago, to a significant episode 5 days prior, followed by recurrent episodes with decreasing time between them and increasing severity, culminating in persistent symptoms that prompted emergency care.
