Let me analyze this case systematically to arrive at a diagnosis:
Key Findings:

Patient Profile:


41-year-old woman
Family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
Hyperextensible digits noted on examination


Presenting Symptoms:


Recurrent chest pain with radiation to jaw and shoulders
Associated dyspnea and diaphoresis
Episodes lasting hours with spontaneous resolution


Laboratory Findings:


Rising troponin (0.03 to 0.21 ng/dl)
Other labs largely normal


Imaging Results:


ECG: ST-segment depressions in V3-V5 that resolved
Echo: Focal hypokinesis in left ventricular inferolateral wall
Coronary angiogram (Figure 2): Shows:

Diffuse narrowing of vessel lumen
Filling defect in first obtuse marginal branch
Evidence of coronary artery dissection


CT angiogram (Figure 3): Shows renal artery abnormalities


Key Contextual Elements:


Family history of vascular complications (cerebral aneurysm)
Presence of connective tissue disorder in family
Recent physical stress (packing)

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is:
Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) in the setting of probable Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
Reasoning:

The coronary angiogram clearly shows evidence of coronary artery dissection
The patient has features suggesting underlying connective tissue disorder (family history, hyperextensible digits)
The presentation is typical for SCAD:

Young woman
Few cardiovascular risk factors
Presentation with acute coronary syndrome
Associated with physical stress


The presence of renal artery irregularities suggests systemic arteriopathy
The combination with probable Ehlers-Danlos syndrome explains the underlying mechanism for arterial fragility

This explains both the acute presentation and provides context for why this otherwise healthy young woman would develop such a condition. The treatment initiated (aspirin, heparin) is appropriate for this diagnosis.
