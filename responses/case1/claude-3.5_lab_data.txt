Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:
Cardiac Markers:

Initial Troponin T: 0.03 ng/dl (at reference range limit of <0.03)
8-hour Troponin T: 0.21 ng/dl (elevated)

Clinical Significance:

The rising troponin pattern indicates acute myocardial injury
The relatively modest elevation is consistent with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)
The delayed rise helped distinguish this from other conditions like myocarditis, where troponin is typically elevated on presentation

Blood Chemistry:

Normal electrolytes (Na 141, K 3.8, Cl 105)
Low CO2: 19 mmol/L (normal 23-32)
Normal renal function (BUN 15, Creatinine 0.91)
Slightly low Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dl (normal 1.7-2.4)

Clinical Significance:

Low CO2 may reflect respiratory compensation from stress/pain
Normal renal function allowed safe administration of medications and contrast
Low magnesium, while mild, could theoretically contribute to vasospasm

Lipid Panel:

Total Cholesterol: 159 mg/dl (<200)
HDL: 63 mg/dl (35-100)
LDL: 86 mg/dl (<130)
Triglycerides: 52 mg/dl (40-150)

Clinical Significance:

Normal lipid profile supports diagnosis of SCAD over atherosclerotic disease
Absence of dyslipidemia is typical in SCAD patients

Metabolic Parameters:

Normal glucose: 98 mg/dl
Normal HbA1c: 4.6%

Clinical Significance:

Absence of diabetes/metabolic derangement
Further supports non-atherosclerotic etiology

Complete Blood Count:

Normal hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dl
Normal hematocrit: 39%
Normal WBC: 7540/mm³
Normal platelets: 316,000/mm³

Clinical Significance:

Absence of anemia rules out demand ischemia
No evidence of infection/inflammation
Normal platelets allowed safe antiplatelet therapy

The laboratory findings collectively support the diagnosis of SCAD by showing:

Evidence of myocardial injury (rising troponin)
Absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors
Normal inflammatory markers
Adequate organ function for therapeutic interventions

The pattern and magnitude of abnormalities helped differentiate this condition from other causes of acute chest pain like atherosclerotic ACS, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism.
