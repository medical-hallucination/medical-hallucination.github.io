## Chronological Order of Key Events:

**1 Year Prior:**

* Transient tightness in chest and shoulder (left side) prompts referral to physical therapy.

**5 Days Prior:**

* Acute substernal chest pain develops while packing for a flight.
* Pain radiates to jaw and shoulders, accompanied by dyspnea and belching sensation.
* Symptoms last 1 hour and resolve spontaneously.

**Day Before Presentation:**

* Substernal chest pain recurs after walking, radiating to jaw and shoulders.
* Pain gradually resolves after a few hours.

**Evening of Presentation (Before Dinner):**

* Chest pain recurs again, associated with light-headedness.
* Persistent pain and dyspnea continue despite attending dinner.

**Presentation:**

* Patient arrives at the emergency department.

**During Hospital Stay:**

* Physical examination is performed.
* Laboratory tests are conducted.
* Electrocardiography (ECG) shows abnormal findings that improve over time.
* Transthoracic echocardiogram shows normal overall function with a small area of hypokinesis.
* Chest X-ray and CT angiography are performed, showing no abnormalities.
* Dr. Vidula orders aspirin, atorvastatin, and intravenous heparin.

## Temporal Relationships between Symptoms and Interventions:

* **Chest tightness (1 year prior) -> Physical Therapy referral (not an intervention)**
* **Acute chest pain (5 days prior) -> No intervention**
* **Recurrent chest pain (day before presentation) -> No intervention**
* **Recurrent chest pain with light-headedness (evening of presentation) -> Hospital presentation**
* **Hospitalization -> Physical examination, laboratory tests, ECG, echocardiogram, chest X-ray, CT angiography**
* **Hospitalization -> Aspirin, atorvastatin, and intravenous heparin administration**

**Note:** The ECG abnormalities appeared to improve over time, suggesting a possible temporal relationship between the chest pain and the ECG findings. However, without further information, it's difficult to say definitively.
