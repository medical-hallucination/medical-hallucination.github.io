Based on the provided text and images, the patient was diagnosed with a spontaneous coronary-artery dissection, specifically a type 1 dissection in the first obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery. This diagnosis is supported by the coronary angiogram (Figure 2) which shows a narrowing of the vessel lumen, a filling defect, and a staining of the vessel wall. Additionally, the patient had several other findings including submillimeter down-sloping ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5 in the ECG (Figure 1), and small, remote infarcts in the kidneys from the CT Angiogram (Figure 3), as well as a rise in Troponin T between presentation and 8 hours after presentation.
