Chronological Order of Key Events and Temporal Relationships
Key Events:
1 Year Prior:

The patient experienced transient tightness in the chest and shoulder, leading to outpatient physical therapy.
5 Days Before Presentation:

Acute substernal chest pain occurred while packing for a flight. Symptoms included pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, dyspnea, and a feeling of needing to belch. These lasted 1 hour and resolved spontaneously.
1 Day Before Presentation:

Substernal chest pain recurred after walking and resolved after a few hours.
Day of Presentation:

Pain returned before dinner and was accompanied by light-headedness. Despite persistent pain, the patient attended dinner but later presented to the emergency department with diaphoresis and dyspnea.
Initial Examination:

Physical examination showed normal vitals except for diaphoresis.
Laboratory results revealed elevated troponin levels and normal imaging studies, excluding aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism.
8 Hours Post-Presentation:

Troponin T increased significantly, indicating myocardial injury.
Echocardiography:

Showed normal ventricular function with localized hypokinesis in the inferolateral wall.
Coronary Angiography:

Confirmed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) in the left circumflex artery.
Management:

Conservative treatment included aspirin, low-dose beta-blockers, and cardiac rehabilitation.
Follow-Up (6 Weeks Later):

Treadmill stress test revealed no diagnostic changes or prolonged chest pain.
Temporal Relationships:
Symptoms and Interventions:

Each episode of chest pain escalated in severity and duration, correlating with progressive myocardial injury, as evidenced by rising troponin levels and imaging findings.
Early interventions (aspirin and beta-blockers) likely mitigated further dissection or myocardial damage.
Familial and Genetic Factors:

A family history of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and associated complications (spontaneous dissection, pneumothorax) suggested a genetic predisposition influencing the patient's condition.
