Based on the presentation of this 41-year-old woman with chest pain, transient ST-segment changes on ECG, minor troponin elevation, a family history of connective tissue disorders, and coronary angiogram findings, the most likely diagnosis is spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). This is consistent with the coronary angiogram findings of a type 1 dissection, which is typical in SCAD, often associated with connective tissue disorders such as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome present in her family history.
