Based on the provided case history, lab data, and diagnostic images, the possible diagnosis for the 41-year-old woman could be Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), with a high likelihood due to the following factors:

Clinical Features Supporting SCAD:
Chest Pain with Radiation:

The recurrent nature of substernal chest pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, typical of ischemic cardiac pain.
Troponin Elevation:

Initial troponin elevation (0.03 ng/dL) with significant increase at 8 hours (0.21 ng/dL), indicating myocardial injury.
Electrocardiogram (ECG):

Submillimeter ST-segment depressions in leads V3, V4, and V5 on presentation, consistent with ischemia, which resolved over time.
Coronary Angiogram Findings:

Evidence of intimal tear and Type 1 coronary artery dissection, visible in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex coronary artery.
Diffuse narrowing of the vessel lumen with filling defects, characteristic of SCAD.
CT Angiogram Findings:

Subtle renal artery irregularities on CT angiography, suggesting systemic vascular abnormalities that may co-occur with SCAD.
Predisposing Factors:
Family History of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS):

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in multiple family members (mother, siblings).
Increased vascular fragility associated with EDS may predispose to SCAD.
Gender and Age:

SCAD is more common in young to middle-aged women without significant cardiovascular risk factors.
Recent Stressors:

Emotional and physical stress related to recent miscarriage and life events.
Differential Diagnoses:
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS):

Less likely in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis or significant plaque burden.
Aortic Dissection:

Ruled out by CT angiography findings.
Myocarditis:

Absence of significant ventricular dysfunction or pericardial effusion makes this less likely.
Coronary Vasospasm:

Does not explain angiographic findings of intimal tear and vessel dissection.
Final Diagnosis:
Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is the most likely diagnosis, particularly given the angiographic evidence, clinical presentation, and predisposing vascular connective tissue disorder (hypermobile EDS).
