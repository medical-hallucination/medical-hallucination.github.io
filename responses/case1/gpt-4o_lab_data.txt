Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance
Key Laboratory Results:
Troponin T:

On Presentation: 0.03 ng/dL (upper limit of normal).
8 Hours After Presentation: 0.21 ng/dL (elevated).
Clinical Significance: Troponin T is a biomarker of myocardial injury. The progressive elevation supports the diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and indicates myocardial injury, consistent with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD).
Complete Blood Count:

Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL (normal).
White Cell Count: 7,540/mm³ (normal).
Platelet Count: 316,000/mm³ (normal).
Clinical Significance: Normal values exclude systemic inflammation or infection as a contributing factor.
Electrolytes and Kidney Function:

Sodium: 141 mmol/L (normal).
Potassium: 3.8 mmol/L (normal).
Creatinine: 0.91 mg/dL (normal).
Clinical Significance: Normal kidney function and electrolyte balance indicate no underlying renal dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances contributing to symptoms.
Magnesium:

Value: 1.6 mg/dL (slightly below normal range of 1.7–2.4 mg/dL).
Clinical Significance: Hypomagnesemia, though mild, can predispose to arrhythmias and exacerbate myocardial irritability, potentially contributing to chest pain.
Glucose:

Value: 98 mg/dL (normal).
Clinical Significance: Normal glucose suggests the patient was not experiencing hyperglycemia or diabetes-related vascular complications.
Cholesterol and Lipid Panel:

Total Cholesterol: 159 mg/dL (normal).
LDL: 86 mg/dL (normal).
HDL: 63 mg/dL (normal).
Triglycerides: 52 mg/dL (normal).
Clinical Significance: The absence of dyslipidemia supports the conclusion that traditional atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is unlikely.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2):

Value: 19 mmol/L (below normal range of 23–32 mmol/L).
Clinical Significance: Mild metabolic acidosis may reflect hyperventilation or a compensatory response to transient ischemia.
Integration with Symptoms:
Chest Pain and Troponin Elevation:

The elevated troponin and associated hypokinesis on echocardiography confirm myocardial injury, correlating with the patient's severe chest pain episodes.
Normal Inflammatory Markers:

The absence of leukocytosis or elevated markers of inflammation rules out infectious or inflammatory causes, such as myocarditis or pericarditis.
Normal Lipid Profile and Lack of Atherosclerotic Risk Factors:

The patient’s lipid profile and family history align with SCAD rather than atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.
Hypomagnesemia:

Although mild, the low magnesium level could contribute to myocardial irritability and risk of arrhythmia during ischemic events.
Metabolic Acidosis:

A low CO2 value might indicate a stress response or hyperventilation during severe chest pain episodes.
Summary:
The laboratory findings support the diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection as the cause of the patient’s symptoms. The troponin elevation reflects myocardial injury, while the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors and inflammatory markers corroborates the clinical suspicion of SCAD. Hypomagnesemia, though mild, may have contributed to increased cardiac vulnerability. These results align with the patient’s presentation and imaging findings.
