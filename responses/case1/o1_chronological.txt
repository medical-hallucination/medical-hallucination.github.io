Below is a concise chronological ordering of the key events, showing when the patient’s symptoms arose in relation to her evaluation and treatment; approximate times (e.g., “1 year before,” “5 days before”) are taken from the case description.

1. One year before presentation:  
   • Intermittent tightness in the left chest and shoulder prompts referral to outpatient physical therapy.  
   • No specific cardiac workup or intervention is mentioned at that time.

2. Five days before presentation:  
   • Acute substernal chest pain develops while the patient is packing for a trip.  
   • Pain radiates to the jaw and shoulders, is accompanied by dyspnea and a feeling of needing to belch, and lasts about one hour.  
   • Symptoms resolve spontaneously; the patient attributes them to fatigue and does not seek medical attention or initiate new therapy.

3. The day before presentation:  
   • Substernal chest pain recurs after walking, again radiating to the jaw and shoulders.  
   • The pain gradually resolves over a few hours.  
   • No new interventions are started.

4. Evening of the day of presentation:  
   • Chest pain recurs before dinner and is associated with lightheadedness and dyspnea.  
   • Pain persists through dinner; the patient then seeks emergency care.  
   • On ED arrival, she is diaphoretic but hemodynamically stable.

5. Initial investigations in the emergency department:  
   • Physical exam shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Good oxygen saturation on ambient air. Hyperextensible digits noted.  
   • Laboratory tests (Table 1) are obtained.  
   • Electrocardiograms reveal submillimeter ST depressions in leads V3–V5, which diminish over the next few hours and then resolve completely by 8 hours after presentation.  
   • Transthoracic echocardiogram shows normal overall systolic function with a focal area of left ventricular inferolateral hypokinesis. No significant valvular disease or pericardial effusion.  
   • Chest radiographs are unremarkable.

6. Advanced imaging:  
   • CT angiography of the chest (with aortic-dissection protocol) shows no aortic dissection or proximal pulmonary embolus and no significant abnormalities in the aorta or coronary arteries.

7. Therapeutic interventions begun after imaging:  
   • Aspirin and atorvastatin are started.  
   • Intravenous heparin is administered.

8. Further diagnostic tests performed; a final diagnosis is determined.

Temporal relationships:  
• The patient had intermittent but progressively alarming chest pains over the course of a year, with a marked increase in both frequency and intensity in the preceding days.  
• No formal cardiac interventions occurred until she presented to the emergency department, at which time imaging and cardiology studies were undertaken.  
• After these diagnostics (normal aortic imaging, focal left ventricular-wall hypokinesis on echocardiography, transient EKG changes), medical therapy with aspirin, a statin, and IV heparin was initiated.
