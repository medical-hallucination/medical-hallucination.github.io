A unifying explanation that fits this patient’s presentation (recurrent exertional chest pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, elevated troponin, minimal conventional coronary‐artery‐disease risk factors, and imaging findings suggestive of a focal intramural tear) is spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). Her family history of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and the tortuosity seen on the angiogram further increase suspicion for an underlying connective‐tissue predisposition to arterial fragility and dissection.

Key points suggesting SCAD include:
* Chest pain consistent with myocardial ischemia (radiation to jaw and shoulders, dyspnea).
* Rising cardiac troponin, indicating myocardial injury in the absence of significant atherosclerosis.
* Coronary angiogram findings of diffuse narrowing, a visible intimal tear, and a filling defect in the obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery—all classic features of a coronary artery dissection rather than plaque rupture.
* Family history of connective‐tissue disorder (hypermobile EDS), which is known to predispose to arterial dissections.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is spontaneous coronary artery dissection leading to an acute coronary syndrome.
