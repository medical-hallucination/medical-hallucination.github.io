Let me break down the key events chronologically:

6 weeks before current evaluation:
- Patient discovers painless lump above left testicle during self-examination

2 weeks before current evaluation (at other hospital):
- Evaluated at primary care physician
- Physical exam confirms soft, nontender "boggy" mass above left testicle
- Initial lab tests performed
- Scrotal ultrasound reveals:
  - Normal testes
  - Left varicocele
  - Right epididymal head cyst (0.6 cm)
  - Incidental finding: Large right kidney mass (11.8 x 10.8 x 9.4 cm)
- Abdominal/pelvic CT confirms:
  - 11 cm mixed solid/cystic mass in right kidney lower pole
  - Mass displacing inferior vena cava to left

Current evaluation (at this hospital):
- Patient referred to urology clinic
- New symptoms reported: mild right flank discomfort and bulge
- Physical exam reveals:
  - Palpable nontender right abdominal mass
  - Grade 2 left varicocele
- Additional testing:
  - Repeat lab work
  - Chest CT shows intrapulmonary lymph node but no metastatic disease

Key temporal relationships:
1. The testicular concern led to imaging that incidentally discovered the more serious renal mass
2. The patient developed right-sided symptoms (flank pain, bulge) sometime between the initial discovery and the current evaluation
3. All lab values remained relatively stable between the two hospital visits
4. No acute changes or rapid progression of findings were noted in the 2-week interval between hospital evaluations
