Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Initial Presentation and Discovery (6 weeks before main evaluation):

Patient found painless lump above left testicle during self-examination
Visited primary care physician at another hospital
Initial examination confirmed soft, nontender "boggy" mass above left testicle
Initial tests and imaging performed:

Laboratory tests (all normal)
Scrotal ultrasound revealed:

Normal testes
Left varicocele
Right epididymal cyst (0.6 cm)
Incidental finding: Large right kidney mass (11.8 x 10.8 x 9.4 cm)





Follow-up Imaging:

CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed:

Confirmed 11 cm mixed solid/cystic mass in right kidney
Thin mural calcification
Mass displaced inferior vena cava
No evidence of metastasis or spread



Specialist Evaluation at MGH:

Referred to urology clinic
Reported mild right flank/upper quadrant discomfort
Physical exam showed:

Palpable nontender right abdominal mass
Grade 2 left varicocele
Otherwise normal exam


Additional testing:

Chest CT showed intrapulmonary lymph node but no metastases
Laboratory tests remained normal



Treatment:

Open right radical nephrectomy performed
Pathology confirmed t(6;11) TFEB translocation renal cell carcinoma
Post-operative surveillance plan initiated

Follow-up (2 years later):

No evidence of recurrent disease or metastasis
Patient returned to work
Wife delivered their second child
Continued surveillance with regular imaging and examinations

This timeline shows that the incidental discovery of the renal mass during evaluation of a testicular concern led to prompt specialist referral and definitive surgical treatment, with good outcomes at 2-year follow-up.
