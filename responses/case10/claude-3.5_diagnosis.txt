Let me analyze this case systematically to reach a diagnosis:
Key Findings:

Patient Demographics and Presentation:


29-year-old male
Incidentally discovered renal mass while evaluating a left testicular mass
Mild right flank discomfort
No constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, night sweats)
Family history of melanoma (father)


Imaging Findings:


Large right renal mass (11.8 × 10.8 × 9.4 cm)
Mixed solid and cystic components
Thin mural calcification
Minimal vascularity on Doppler
No evidence of metastasis or lymphadenopathy
Displaces IVC but no venous invasion


Histopathology (from nephrectomy specimen):


Nests of large cells with clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm
Smaller cells with eosinophilic hyalinized material
Immunohistochemistry:

Negative for epithelial marker EMA
Positive for melanocytic marker melan-a



Based on these findings, particularly the histopathology and immunohistochemistry results, the most likely diagnosis is:
Primary Renal PEComa (Perivascular Epithelioid Cell tumor)
Reasoning:

The histological pattern of nests of clear cells
Immunohistochemical profile (melan-a positive, EMA negative)
Mixed solid-cystic appearance with calcification
The patient's young age
The relatively large size
Lack of typical features of more common renal tumors like clear cell RCC

This is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm belonging to the family of PEComas, which are characterized by distinctive perivascular epithelioid cells that show both smooth muscle and melanocytic differentiation. The positive melan-a staining and negative epithelial marker strongly support this diagnosis.
Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this diagnosis or discuss differential diagnoses?
