Let me analyze the laboratory findings systematically:
Blood Tests Analysis:

Complete Blood Count:


Hemoglobin: 14.3 g/dl (normal: 13.5-17.5)
Hematocrit: 43.1% (normal: 41.0-53.0)
White blood cell count: 6940/mm³ (normal: 4500-11,000)
Platelet count: 220,000/mm³ (normal: 150,000-400,000)
Clinical Significance: All values were normal, indicating:
No anemia (which could suggest bleeding from the tumor)
No infection or inflammatory response
Normal platelet function for coagulation


Metabolic Panel:


Sodium: 143 mmol/L (normal: 135-145)
Potassium: 4.1 mmol/L (normal: 3.4-5.0)
Chloride: 103 mmol/L (normal: 100-108)
CO2: 25 mmol/L (normal: 23-32)
BUN: 12 mg/dl (normal: 8-25)
Creatinine: 0.82 mg/dl (normal: 0.60-1.50)
Clinical Significance:
Normal electrolyte balance
Normal kidney function despite the large renal mass
No evidence of paraneoplastic syndrome


Coagulation Studies:


PT: 14.2 sec (normal: 11.0-14.0)
INR: 1.2 (normal: 0.9-1.1)
PTT: 25.6 sec (normal: 22.0-35.0)
Clinical Significance:
Slightly elevated PT/INR but not clinically significant
Normal coagulation profile overall, important for surgical planning


Urinalysis:


Specific gravity: 1.020 (normal: 1.001-1.035)
pH: 5.5 (normal: 5.0-9.0)
Red cells: Negative
White cells: Negative
Nitrite: Negative
Protein: Negative
Clinical Significance:
Normal urinary function
No hematuria despite renal mass
No evidence of urinary tract infection
No proteinuria suggesting preserved kidney function

Overall Clinical Correlation:

Tumor Impact:


Despite the large renal mass, kidney function remained normal
No evidence of systemic effects from the tumor
No paraneoplastic manifestations


Surgical Considerations:


Normal coagulation profile favorable for surgery
Well-preserved kidney function suggesting good compensation by the contralateral kidney


Disease Staging:


Normal laboratory values suggest localized disease
No evidence of metastatic involvement or systemic inflammation
Good baseline organ function for treatment planning


Prognosis Indicators:


Normal baseline labs suggest good physiologic reserve
Well-preserved organ function indicates ability to tolerate treatment
No concerning laboratory abnormalities that would suggest advanced disease

The laboratory findings support the clinical picture of an incidentally discovered renal mass that, despite its size, had not yet caused systemic manifestations or impaired organ function. This correlates with the patient's relatively mild symptoms and good performance status.
