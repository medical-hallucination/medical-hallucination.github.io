## Chronological Order of Key Events

Here's a chronological breakdown of the key events, along with the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

1. **Incidentally Discovered Renal Mass:**
   * A painless lump is discovered above the left testicle during a self-examination.
   * A primary care physician confirms a soft, nontender mass on the superior aspect of the left testicle.

2. **Initial Diagnostic Imaging:**
   * Ultrasound of the scrotum and testes reveals a normal left testicle, a varicocele, and a small cyst on the right epididymis.
   * More importantly, an incidental mixed solid and cystic mass is identified on the lower aspect of the right kidney.

3. **Further Imaging and Evaluation:**
   * CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirms the renal mass and provides more detailed information about its size and characteristics.
   * The patient is referred to a urologist for further evaluation.

4. **Urological Evaluation:**
   * The patient reports mild discomfort in the right flank and upper quadrant, along with a small bulge in that area.
   * Physical examination reveals a palpable nontender mass in the right abdomen.
   * Additional blood tests are ordered to assess overall health and kidney function.

5. **Diagnostic and Management Decisions:**
   * Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results, a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan will be determined. This may involve further diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy, or direct surgical intervention.

**Temporal Relationships:**

* The discovery of the scrotal mass prompted the initial evaluation and led to the incidental finding of the renal mass.
* The renal mass was asymptomatic until the patient began experiencing mild flank pain and noticed a palpable abdominal mass.
* The timeline between the initial discovery of the scrotal mass and the development of renal mass-related symptoms is not explicitly stated. 

It's important to note that the specific timing of diagnostic and management decisions will depend on the patient's clinical condition, the urgency of the situation, and the expertise of the healthcare team.
