Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is a renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Here are the key points supporting this diagnosis:

Clinical Presentation:

Palpable mass in the right flank
Mild flank pain
Incidental scrotal mass (likely unrelated)
Imaging Findings:

CT scan shows a large, solid and cystic mass in the lower pole of the right kidney with calcifications
Displacement of the inferior vena cava
Laboratory Data:

Generally unremarkable, with no significant abnormalities suggesting metastatic disease or other systemic issues
Additional Considerations:

Patient's age and medical history: RCC is more common in adults, and the patient's family history is not suggestive of hereditary cancer syndromes associated with RCC.
While other diagnoses like renal cysts or oncocytoma could be considered initially, the size, solid and cystic components, calcifications, and displacement of the inferior vena cava on CT are highly suggestive of RCC.

It's important to note that a definitive diagnosis would require a biopsy of the renal mass, which would be the next step in management.
