Based on the provided presentation, lab data, and images, the most likely diagnosis is **Primary Renal Melanoma**.

Here's a breakdown of the findings supporting this diagnosis:

**Presentation:**

*   **Incidental Finding:** The renal mass was discovered incidentally during evaluation for a left testicular mass (which turned out to be a varicocele). This is a common way renal masses are found.
*   **Mild Symptoms:** The patient reports mild flank and right upper quadrant discomfort, and a palpable mass in that area. These symptoms are not very specific, and could be caused by the mass itself.
*   **No Systemic Symptoms:** He had no typical symptoms associated with renal cancer, such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, hematuria, or lymphadenopathy.
*   **Family History:** Although the patient has a family history of cancer, no genitourinary malignancies are reported.

**Lab Data:**

*   **Mostly Normal:** The lab values are largely within the normal range.  The slight elevation in prothrombin time and INR are of unclear significance in this context. The most important point here is that there is nothing in the lab results to suggest a common form of renal carcinoma which often has elevated LDH or anemia

**Imaging:**

*   **Ultrasound:** Revealed a large (10.8cm) mixed solid and cystic mass in the right kidney, and a left varicocele. This suggests a complex renal mass
*   **CT Scan:** Confirmed a 11cm mixed solid and cystic mass at the lower pole of the right kidney with thin mural calcification. Importantly, no evidence of hydronephrosis or local invasion or distant metastasis. The IVC is displaced to the left, indicating the mass is likely arising from the right kidney
*   **Chest CT:** The presence of an intrapulmonary lymph node is non-specific and doesn't support metastatic disease.

**Histopathology (Fig. 3):**

*   **Melanocytic Features:**  The tumor cells are arranged in nests, with clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm. Importantly, the tumor cells are positive for Melan-A, a melanocytic marker, and negative for EMA, an epithelial marker. This rules out typical Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC).

**Key Points Favoring Primary Renal Melanoma:**

1.  **Rarity:**  Primary renal melanoma is an extremely rare entity (vs. more common Renal Cell Carcinoma).
2.  **Melanocytic Marker:** The tumor's positive staining for melan-A is the most critical clue.
3. **Histological Morphology:**  Nests of clear to eosinophilic cells in the kidney is not typical for common RCC subtypes.
4.  **Lack of Common RCC Features:** This patient does not have features common for RCC, such as hematuria, anemia, and elevation in LDH.

**Differential Diagnoses:**

While Primary Renal Melanoma is most likely, here are a few considerations:

*   **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):** While the imaging features could be similar, the histopathology with melan-A positivity and EMA negativity makes this unlikely. Histological subtypes of RCC are typically EMA positive.
*   **Metastatic Melanoma:**  A primary melanoma elsewhere with metastasis to the kidney is an option to consider, however there was no mention of any prior melanoma.
*   **Other rare renal tumors:** There are a variety of other very rare renal tumors, but the melanocytic marker staining is the most striking feature in this case

**In Conclusion**

The patient's incidental renal mass, its mixed cystic and solid features on imaging, and especially the histopathology showing melanocytic features are all highly suggestive of a rare **primary renal melanoma**. The lack of evidence for a primary melanoma elsewhere and the negative EMA staining further reinforces this diagnosis.
