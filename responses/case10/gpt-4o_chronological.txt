Here is a chronological ordering of key events with temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

### Timeline of Key Events

1. **6 Weeks Before Evaluation**
   - The patient identified a **painless lump** above his left testicle during a monthly self-examination.
   - **Intervention**: The patient was evaluated at his primary care physician's office, where a soft, nontender, "boggy" mass was confirmed.

2. **Initial Workup at Another Hospital**
   - **Ultrasonography** of the scrotum and testes revealed:
     - Normal testes.
     - Left varicocele.
     - Right epididymal cyst (0.6 cm).
     - An incidental finding: a **mixed solid and cystic renal mass** (11.8 cm by 10.8 cm by 9.4 cm) on the right kidney.
   - **CT of the abdomen and pelvis** (with contrast) confirmed:
     - A solid and cystic renal mass (11 cm diameter) at the lower pole of the right kidney.
     - Displacement of the inferior vena cava without invasion.
     - No hydronephrosis, venous invasion, lymphadenopathy, or distant lesions.

3. **Referral to the Urology Clinic**
   - The patient was referred to the urology clinic of the current hospital for further evaluation.
   - **Symptoms at this point**:
     - Mild discomfort in the **right flank** and **right upper quadrant**.
     - A palpable **abdominal bulge** in the same area.
     - A previously noted **left scrotal mass**.
   - A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable, with no systemic signs of malignancy (e.g., fever, night sweats, weight loss).

4. **Physical Examination at Current Hospital**
   - A palpable, nontender mass in the **right abdomen**, inferior to the liver, was noted.
   - Genitourinary findings included a **grade 2 left varicocele**, with otherwise normal testes and scrotum.

5. **Laboratory Tests at Current Hospital**
   - Blood and urine tests were normal except for:
     - Slightly elevated **prothrombin time (14.2 sec)** and **INR (1.2)**.
   - No evidence of renal dysfunction or systemic inflammation.

6. **CT of the Chest**
   - Revealed an **intrapulmonary lymph node**, with no pulmonary nodules or lymphadenopathy.

### Temporal Relationships

- **Testicular Symptoms and Renal Mass**: The incidental discovery of the renal mass occurred during evaluation for the left scrotal mass, which turned out to be unrelated (likely due to the left varicocele and right epididymal cyst).
  
- **Onset of Discomfort and Diagnosis**: Mild flank discomfort and abdominal bulge emerged after the renal mass was identified, suggesting that the mass had grown large enough to displace adjacent structures.

- **No Systemic Symptoms**: The absence of systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss suggests no metastatic or inflammatory involvement at this stage.

- **Sequential Imaging and Testing**: The renal mass diagnosis was refined through sequential imaging (ultrasound, CT) and laboratory tests, excluding immediate metastasis or significant organ dysfunction.

This timeline clarifies the progression of symptoms and the systematic diagnostic approach taken to assess and manage the renal mass.
