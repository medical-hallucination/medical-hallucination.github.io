Key Chronological Events and Temporal Relationships:
Six weeks before evaluation:

The patient identified a painless lump above the left testicle during a self-examination.
Primary care physician confirmed a soft, nontender, "boggy" mass superior to the left testicle.
Ultrasonography revealed a left varicocele, a right epididymal cyst, and an incidental large (11.8 cm x 10.8 cm x 9.4 cm) mixed solid and cystic renal mass.
Two weeks before evaluation:

CT of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed a mixed solid and cystic renal mass (11 cm in diameter) with thin mural calcifications and no signs of metastasis or venous invasion.
At presentation:

Referral to the urology clinic.
Complaints of mild discomfort in the right flank and a palpable mass in the right abdomen, with no systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss).
Blood and urine tests were within normal limits.
CT chest revealed a benign intrapulmonary lymph node with no signs of metastasis.
Evaluation at the hospital:

Urologic examination confirmed a grade 2 varicocele on the left.
A differential diagnosis was discussed, ruling out testicular cancer, benign renal tumors, and other potential causes, including infectious or inflammatory processes.
Diagnostic Decision:

A diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was made, with a suspicion of MiT family translocation RCC based on the patient's age and imaging findings.
Intervention:

An open right radical nephrectomy was performed due to the large size and displacement of adjacent structures by the tumor.
Pathological evaluation confirmed t(6;11) TFEB translocation RCC.
Post-surgical management:

Postoperative surveillance was recommended every 3â€“6 months, including physical exams, metabolic panels, and imaging.
Genetic counseling was suggested due to the family history of cancer and the rare nature of the tumor.
Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions:
The incidental finding of the renal mass during the evaluation of the scrotal mass prompted early diagnostic imaging and subsequent referral.
The lack of systemic symptoms and normal laboratory findings supported localized disease, leading to timely surgical intervention.
Early detection and management likely contributed to a favorable prognosis.
