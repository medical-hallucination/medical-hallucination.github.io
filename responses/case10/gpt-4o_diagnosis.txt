The presentation and findings suggest a possible diagnosis of renal oncocytoma or, more likely, a renal cell carcinoma (RCC), considering the characteristics and size of the renal mass.

Key points supporting this:

1. **Demographics and Symptoms**: The patient is a 29-year-old male, which is younger than average for RCC, but the presence of a large, asymptomatic renal mass fits the profile.

2. **Imaging Findings**: The CT and ultrasound reveal a mixed solid and cystic mass at the lower pole of the right kidney, with thin mural calcifications and no evidence of metastasis. This pattern can be seen in both renal oncocytoma and RCC, but the aggressive size might lean more towards RCC.

3. **Histological Features**: The nephrectomy specimen shows nests of larger cells with abundant clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm, which are characteristic of oncocytoma, but can also be seen in clear cell RCC. The immunohistochemical staining (negative for EMA and positive for melan-a) further supports these possibilities.

4. **Lab Data**: Lab results are unremarkable, with no indicators of systemic involvement or paraneoplastic syndromes.

In conclusion, while the benign renal oncocytoma is a differential diagnosis, the presentation and characteristics of the mass suggest a higher likelihood of renal cell carcinoma. Further pathological examination would be essential for definitive diagnosis.
