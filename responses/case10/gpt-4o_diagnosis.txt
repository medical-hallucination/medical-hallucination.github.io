Based on the information provided:

Ultrasonographic Findings:

The patient has a large mixed solid and cystic mass (11.8 cm x 10.8 cm x 9.4 cm) arising from the lower aspect of the right kidney, visible on ultrasonography.
Color Doppler shows minimal vascularity of the mass.
CT Imaging:

Confirms the presence of a mixed solid and cystic mass at the lower pole of the right kidney with thin mural calcifications and no evidence of metastatic disease (no lymphadenopathy or venous invasion).
Microscopic Analysis:

Tumor contains clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm and nests of cells with eosinophilic hyalinized material.
Immunohistochemistry findings: Negative for epithelial marker EMA and positive for melanocytic marker melan-A.
Clinical Presentation:

The patient has mild discomfort in the right flank, no systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss), and normal renal function on laboratory tests.
Family History:

Significant for gastrointestinal stromal tumor in the mother and melanoma in the father.
Possible Diagnosis
The findings strongly suggest renal angiomyolipoma (AML) or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a focus on distinguishing between:

Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC):
Fits the radiographic description of a mixed solid and cystic renal mass with thin calcifications.
Immunohistochemistry positive for melan-A could suggest an association with melanoma but may also overlap with RCC.
Angiomyolipoma with Atypia:
Typically less vascular on imaging and may show minimal enhancement.
The histological description (e.g., eosinophilic material, clear cytoplasm) is compatible.
Further diagnostic steps would include:

Histopathological confirmation after biopsy or nephrectomy.
Staging workup to assess for any metastatic disease.
