Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance:
Blood Findings:

Hemoglobin (14.3 g/dL) and hematocrit (43.1%): Within normal limits, indicating no evidence of anemia or significant blood loss. This aligns with the absence of hematuria or other signs of chronic blood loss from the renal mass.
White blood cell count (6,940/mm³): Normal, ruling out systemic infection or inflammation. This is consistent with the lack of fever or other systemic inflammatory symptoms.
Platelet count (220,000/mm³): Normal, indicating no thrombocytopenia or hypercoagulability.
Electrolytes and Kidney Function:

Sodium (143 mmol/L), potassium (4.1 mmol/L), chloride (103 mmol/L), carbon dioxide (25 mmol/L): Normal, indicating stable electrolyte balance.
Urea nitrogen (12 mg/dL) and creatinine (0.82 mg/dL): Normal renal function, suggesting that the renal mass has not caused significant impairment of the unaffected renal parenchyma or obstruction.
Calcium (9.4 mg/dL): Normal, ruling out hypercalcemia, which can be associated with paraneoplastic syndromes in renal cell carcinoma.
Liver Function:

Albumin (4.9 g/dL), total protein, and liver enzymes: Normal, suggesting no liver involvement or paraneoplastic hypoalbuminemia.
Coagulation Profile:

Prothrombin time (14.2 seconds) and INR (1.2): Slightly elevated but within an acceptable range. This does not indicate significant coagulopathy but may reflect mild changes due to tumor-related factors.
Urinalysis:

Specific gravity (1.020): Normal concentration ability of the kidney.
Negative red cells, white cells, nitrites, and protein: Absence of hematuria or urinary tract infection, ruling out gross renal parenchymal damage or infection.
Glycated Hemoglobin (5.9%):

Slightly elevated, indicating borderline glucose dysregulation, but not diagnostic of diabetes. This is not directly related to the renal mass.
Clinical Significance:
Normal Renal Function:

The patient’s creatinine and urea nitrogen levels are within normal limits, reflecting the functional compensation of the unaffected kidney despite the large mass in the right kidney.
Absence of hematuria (both microscopic and gross) is notable, as hematuria is a common symptom in renal malignancies. This might suggest that the tumor has not invaded the renal pelvis or urinary tract.
Absence of Systemic Effects:

The normal white cell count, absence of fever, and normal inflammatory markers indicate a lack of systemic inflammatory or infectious processes. This aligns with the localized nature of the tumor.
No Paraneoplastic Syndromes:

Normal calcium levels and absence of significant anemia suggest that the tumor is not secreting parathyroid hormone-related peptides (common in some renal cell carcinomas) or causing chronic blood loss.
Slightly Elevated Glycated Hemoglobin:

While not directly related to the tumor, this finding may warrant long-term monitoring for metabolic health, especially considering the patient’s young age.
Summary:
The laboratory findings are overall unremarkable and support the clinical impression of a localized renal mass without systemic involvement or significant disruption of renal or metabolic functions. These findings, combined with imaging and pathology, further strengthen the diagnosis of a localized renal cell carcinoma. Early surgical intervention was appropriate, given the lack of systemic compromise and preserved renal function.
