From inspection of the laboratory data (Table 1), the patient’s routine blood tests and urinalysis are essentially within normal limits. Several points are clinically noteworthy:

1. Normal Blood Counts
* Hemoglobin and hematocrit are within reference ranges, indicating no anemia or polycythemia.
* White‑cell count is normal (6940 per mm³), without evidence of leukocytosis or leukopenia.
* Platelet count is also normal (220,000 per mm³), suggesting no thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia.

2. Normal Renal and Electrolyte Profiles
* Serum creatinine (0.82 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (12 mg/dL) are within normal ranges, indicating preserved renal function despite the large renal mass.
* Serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate) are likewise normal, reinforcing the absence of major metabolic disturbances.

3. Glucose, Calcium, and Albumin
* Blood glucose (97 mg/dL), calcium (9.4 mg/dL), and albumin (4.9 g/dL) all fall comfortably within normal limits, indicating no overt endocrine or nutritional abnormalities.

4. Coagulation Parameters
* The prothrombin time (14.2 sec) is at the upper limit of normal, and the INR (1.2) is slightly elevated relative to the reference range (0.9–1.1). These mild findings do not necessarily point to a clinically significant coagulopathy but merit awareness in the perioperative setting should surgical intervention be required.
* The partial‑thromboplastin time is within normal limits (25.6 sec).

5. Urinalysis
* Specific gravity, pH, and the absence of red cells, white cells, nitrites, or protein all indicate that there is no active infection, hematuria, or proteinuria.

Taken together, these normal laboratory findings suggest that, aside from the incidentally discovered renal mass (and a left‑sided varicocele noted on examination), the patient is in generally good health. Importantly, the lack of abnormalities in renal function tests (creatinine and BUN) indicates that the large right renal mass has not yet compromised overall kidney function. Furthermore, the absence of anemia, significant coagulopathy, or evidence of infection reduces concern for systemic effects from a malignancy (such as paraneoplastic anemia) or other complicated pathology.
Overall, the labs help confirm that the patient’s mild right‑flank discomfort is not accompanied by laboratory evidence of renal failure, infection, or a hematologic disorder, thus allowing the clinical focus to remain on fully characterizing and managing the incidentally discovered renal tumor.
