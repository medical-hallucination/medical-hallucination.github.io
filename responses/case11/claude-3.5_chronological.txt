Here is a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

30 years ago:
- Patient developed chronic left-sided abdominal pain after birth of youngest child
- This pain remained stable and unchanged for 30 years

2 years before presentation:
- Developed episodes of epigastric pain radiating to chest, worse after meals
- Evaluated in Guatemala and found to have H. pylori infection
- Pain improved with proton pump inhibitor therapy but wasn't treated with antibiotics

10 months before presentation:
- Had episode of epigastric pain while visiting New England
- Evaluated at hospital emergency department
- Pain persisted despite 3 days of proton pump inhibitor therapy
- Labs and tests were done (results in Table 1)

5 months before presentation:
- Developed fevers and throbbing left ear/facial pain radiating to jaw
- Had neck stiffness and tinnitus
- Evaluated in Guatemala - CT showed sinusitis and otitis media
- Fevers and neck stiffness resolved without treatment
- Ear and facial pain persisted despite acetaminophen

Initial presentation:
- Came to community health center to establish primary care
- Reported 7kg intentional weight loss over prior 6 months
- Still had persistent left ear/facial pain
- Tested positive for latent TB
- Normal chest x-ray

1 month after initial presentation:
- Returned to discuss TB treatment options
- Reported new 2-month history of right upper/lower quadrant pain
- CT showed colonic mass
- Underwent colonoscopy showing mass
- Had laparoscopic right colectomy
- Pathology revealed Angiostrongylus costaricensis infection

The temporal progression shows an initially stable chronic abdominal condition that was joined by new upper GI symptoms, followed by ear/facial symptoms, and finally the discovery of the parasitic colonic mass. The interventions became progressively more intensive as new symptoms developed, culminating in surgery.
