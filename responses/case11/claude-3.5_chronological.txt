Let me organize the key events chronologically:

30 Years Ago:
- Development of chronic left-sided abdominal pain after childbirth
- Pain remained constant and unchanged for 30 years

2 Years Before Presentation:
- Development of epigastric pain
- Evaluation in Guatemala revealed H. pylori infection
- Symptoms improved with PPI therapy (no antibiotics given)

10 Months Before Presentation:
- Visited New England
- Emergency department visit for epigastric pain
- Pain didn't improve after 3 days of PPI
- Tests showed negative H. pylori antigen
- Patient returned to Guatemala after symptoms resolved

5-6 Months Before Presentation:
- Began intentional weight loss (7 kg over 6 months)
- Development of fevers and left ear/facial pain
- CT in Guatemala showed sinusitis and otitis media
- Fevers resolved without treatment
- Ear and facial pain persisted despite acetaminophen

2 Months Before Latest Visit:
- Development of right upper and lower quadrant pain

Initial Presentation at Community Health Center:
- Evaluation for primary care
- Positive interferon-Î³ release assay for TB
- Normal chest radiograph

1 Month After Initial Presentation:
- Follow-up visit to discuss TB treatment
- First mention of right-sided abdominal pain
- CT revealed ascending colon mass with lymphadenopathy

This timeline shows a progression from chronic stable symptoms (left-sided abdominal pain) to new symptoms developing over the past 2 years, with the most concerning findings (right-sided pain and colon mass) appearing in the most recent months.
