Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

Key Abnormal Findings:
1. Eosinophilia
- Initial value: 3.8% (10 months before presentation)
- Increased to 19.5% at presentation (normal range 0-8%)
- Absolute eosinophil count was 2,633/mm続 (>1500/mm続 is significant)
- Clinical significance: Strongly suggestive of parasitic infection, especially helminth infections that migrate through tissues

2. White Blood Cell Count
- Increased from 9,430 to 13,500/mm続 (normal range 4,500-11,000)
- Clinical significance: Mild leukocytosis indicating inflammatory/infectious process

3. Platelet Count
- Increased from 349,000 to 406,000/mm続 (normal range 150,000-400,000)
- Clinical significance: Mild thrombocytosis, can be seen with inflammation

4. Liver Function Tests
- Initially elevated:
  - ALT: 62 U/L (normal 7-33)
  - AST: 40 U/L (normal 9-32)
  - Alkaline phosphatase: 177 U/L (normal 30-100)
- Normalized at presentation
- Clinical significance: Initial hepatic inflammation that resolved

Normal Findings of Note:
1. Hemoglobin/Hematocrit: Remained within normal range
2. Kidney function tests: Normal
3. Lipase: Normal at 30 U/L
4. Carcinoembryonic antigen: Normal at 2.2 ng/mL

Clinical Correlation:
1. The marked eosinophilia correlated with:
- Patient's exposure history (consuming freshwater crustaceans in Guatemala)
- The colonic mass found on imaging
- Ultimate diagnosis of Angiostrongylus costaricensis infection

2. The progression of laboratory values shows:
- Evolution from mild to marked eosinophilia
- Resolution of liver function abnormalities
- Development of inflammatory response (leukocytosis, thrombocytosis)

3. The normal CEA helped rule out colorectal cancer as a cause of the colonic mass

4. The laboratory pattern strongly supported a parasitic etiology rather than:
- Malignancy
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Tuberculosis (despite positive interferon-gamma release assay)

This laboratory pattern, particularly the marked eosinophilia, was crucial in guiding the diagnostic process toward a parasitic infection rather than other causes of colonic mass.
