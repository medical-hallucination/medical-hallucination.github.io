**Chronological Order of Key Events:**

1. **5 months prior to initial presentation:**
   * Onset of fevers, throbbing left ear and facial pain, neck stiffness, and tinnitus.
   * CT scan in Guatemala suggests sinusitis and otitis media.
   * Fevers and neck stiffness resolve, but ear and facial pain persist.

2. **6 months prior to initial presentation:**
   * Intentional weight loss of 7 kg due to dietary changes.

3. **2 years prior to initial presentation:**
   * Onset of epigastric pain, burning in quality, radiating to the chest, and associated with diarrhea.
   * H. pylori infection diagnosed in Guatemala but not treated with antibiotics.
   * Epigastric pain improves with intermittent proton-pump inhibitor therapy.

4. **10 months prior to initial presentation:**
   * Epigastric pain in New England, unresponsive to 3 days of proton-pump inhibitor therapy.
   * Negative stool culture and H. pylori antigen test.
   * Referred to primary care but pain resolves.

5. **Initial presentation to community health center:**
   * Persistent left ear and facial pain.
   * Intermittent right upper and lower quadrant pain (onset 2 months prior).
   * Positive interferon-gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis.
   * Chest X-ray normal.

6. **One month after initial presentation:**
   * CT scan of abdomen reveals irregular, circumferential mass in the ascending colon with pericolonic stranding and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.

**Temporal Relationships:**

* The initial ear and facial pain preceded the abdominal symptoms.
* The abdominal pain, particularly the epigastric pain, seems to have a recurrent nature, with periods of remission and exacerbation.
* The recent onset of right upper and lower quadrant pain is a new development.
* The positive tuberculosis test raises concerns about potential immune compromise and its impact on other infections.
