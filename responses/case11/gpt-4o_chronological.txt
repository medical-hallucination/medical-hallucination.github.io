### Chronology of Key Events and Temporal Relationships:

1. **5 Months Before Presentation**:
   - The patient experienced **fever, ear and facial pain**, and **neck stiffness** in Guatemala.
   - Diagnosis: **Sinusitis and otitis media of the left ear**.
   - Symptoms partially resolved (fevers and neck stiffness) without specific treatment, but ear and facial pain persisted.

2. **2 Years Before Presentation**:
   - Episodes of **epigastric pain**, burning in quality, radiated to the chest after meals, and associated with diarrhea.
   - Diagnosis: **Helicobacter pylori infection** (not treated with antibiotics).
   - Intervention: **Intermittent proton-pump inhibitor therapy** reduced epigastric pain.

3. **10 Months Before Presentation**:
   - Visit to an emergency department in New England for recurrent **epigastric pain**.
   - Intervention: Proton-pump inhibitors, but symptoms did not resolve.

4. **Presentation to the Community Health Center**:
   - Chronic left-sided **abdominal pain** and **weight loss** reported.
   - Medications included acetaminophen and jaw exercises recommended for **facial pain**.
   - Interferon-Î³ release assay for **Mycobacterium tuberculosis** returned positive.

5. **1 Month After Initial Visit**:
   - New complaint of **intermittent abdominal pain** in the right quadrants.
   - **CT imaging** revealed a mass in the ascending colon with surrounding inflammation.
   - Colonoscopy performed: A **noncircumferential mass** with biopsy.

6. **Pathological Diagnosis**:
   - Findings of **eosinophilic vasculitis** with intravascular nematode consistent with **Angiostrongylus costaricensis**.

7. **Surgical Intervention**:
   - **Laparoscopic right colectomy** performed; patient discharged on postoperative day 2.

### Temporal Relationships:
- **Symptoms of epigastric and chronic abdominal pain** preceded the detection of the colonic mass, and interventions (proton-pump inhibitors) temporarily relieved symptoms.
- The development of **eosinophilia** and the colon mass correlated with parasitic exposure, dietary habits, and travel history.
- The **positive tuberculosis test** prompted investigations, but the eventual diagnosis tied eosinophilia and the mass to a parasitic etiology.
