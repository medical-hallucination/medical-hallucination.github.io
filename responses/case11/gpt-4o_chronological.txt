### Chronology of Key Events and Temporal Relationships:

1. **5 Months Before Presentation**:
   - **Symptoms**: Fevers, throbbing pain in the left ear and face, neck stiffness, and tinnitus develop.
   - **Evaluation**: CT scan in Guatemala suggests sinusitis and otitis media.
   - **Outcome**: Fevers and neck stiffness resolve without specific treatment, but ear and facial pain persist.

2. **6 Months Before Presentation**:
   - **Symptoms**: The patient begins an intentional weight loss of 7 kg, attributed to dietary changes.

3. **2 Years Before Presentation**:
   - **Symptoms**: Episodes of epigastric pain (burning quality, radiating to the chest, occurring after meals, associated with diarrhea) develop.
   - **Evaluation**: Diagnosed with *Helicobacter pylori* infection in Guatemala.
   - **Intervention**: Treated intermittently with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) but not antibiotics.
   - **Outcome**: Epigastric pain diminishes.

4. **10 Months Before Presentation**:
   - **Symptoms**: Severe epigastric pain persists despite 3 days of PPI therapy.
   - **Evaluation**: Presented to the emergency department in New England.
     - **Findings**: Normal urinalysis, kidney function, glucose, electrolytes, and lipase levels; negative stool *H. pylori* antigen test.
   - **Outcome**: Pain resolved without intervention, and the patient returned to Guatemala.

5. **Presentation to Community Health Center**:
   - **Symptoms**: Persistent ear and facial pain, tenderness in the left temporomandibular joint, and a history of waxing and waning abdominal pain.
   - **Evaluation**: Physical examination reveals a systolic murmur and tenderness on the left side of the face; glycated hemoglobin and lipid panel are normal. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C are negative. Positive interferon-γ release assay suggests latent tuberculosis infection.
   - **Intervention**: Acetaminophen and jaw exercises for facial pain, referral for mammography and colonoscopy.

6. **Two Days Later**:
   - **Diagnostic Imaging**: Chest radiograph is normal with no evidence of active tuberculosis.

7. **1 Month After Initial Visit**:
   - **New Symptoms**: Reports a 2-month history of intermittent pain in the right upper and lower quadrants.
   - **Evaluation**: CT of the abdomen and pelvis reveals:
     - An irregular, circumferential mass in the ascending colon with transmural extension and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
     - Appendix wall thickening, likely secondary to adjacent colonic inflammation.

### Temporal Relationships:
- Persistent ear and facial pain (5 months prior) preceded the discovery of latent tuberculosis (positive interferon-γ release assay).
- Epigastric pain episodes (2 years prior) are unrelated to the ascending colon mass but suggest a history of gastrointestinal distress.
- Abdominal pain in the right quadrants (2 months before re-presentation) aligns temporally with findings of a colon mass and inflammation. 
- Weight loss coincided with the later stages of symptoms, possibly due to dietary changes or underlying malignancy.
