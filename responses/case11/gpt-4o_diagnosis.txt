Based on the presentation of symptoms, laboratory data, and CT imaging findings:

### Possible Diagnosis:
1. **Colonic Adenocarcinoma (Colon Cancer):**
   - The CT imaging findings of an irregular, circumferential mass in the ascending colon with transmural extension and stranding in the pericolonic fat are highly suggestive of a malignant process, likely adenocarcinoma.
   - Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the mass indicate possible regional lymph node involvement, a common feature of colon cancer.
   - The patient's unexplained weight loss and lack of significant change in abdominal pain over time align with cancer-associated symptoms.

2. **Inflammatory/Infectious Conditions (Less Likely):**
   - The appendix's mild wall thickening might suggest appendiceal inflammation. However, this is more likely secondary to the adjacent colonic process.
   - Tuberculosis of the gastrointestinal tract is a differential to consider, especially with the patient's positive interferon-gamma release assay and exposure history, but the CT findings and lack of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, significant abdominal pain) make this less likely.

3. **Chronic Inflammatory Conditions (Less Likely):**
   - Conditions such as Crohn's disease or chronic colitis could cause inflammation with transmural extension and lymphadenopathy. However, the absence of a long-standing history of gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, blood in stool) and the mass-like feature on imaging make this less probable.

### Next Steps:
1. **Colonoscopy with Biopsy:** Direct visualization and histopathological evaluation are crucial for confirming the diagnosis and differentiating between malignancy and other causes.
2. **CEA Levels:** Carcinoembryonic antigen levels could be checked as a tumor marker for colon cancer.
3. **Further Imaging or Staging Studies:** To evaluate for metastatic disease if cancer is confirmed.
