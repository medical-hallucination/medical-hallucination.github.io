Based on the presentation of this case, the possible diagnosis is intestinal anisakiasis. 

This diagnosis is suggested by the following findings:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient's symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper and lower quadrants, combined with history of consuming raw or undercooked fish or seafood, are suggestive of a parasitic infection.

2. **Radiological Findings**: The CT scan reveals an irregular circumferential mass in the ascending colon with transmural extension, stranding in the adjacent pericolonic fat, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings indicate a significant inflammatory process, which could be due to a parasitic infection.

3. **Histological Findings**: The histology from the colectomy specimens shows vasculitis and an intravascular structure resembling a nematode, consistent with a parasitic infection such as anisakiasis, which is caused by the ingestion of larval nematodes from infected seafood.

Anisakiasis should be considered, especially with the patient's history of consuming freshwater seafood and the presence of eosinophilia suggestive of a parasitic infection. Further confirmation may require specific serologic testing or additional parasitological examination of the tissue.
