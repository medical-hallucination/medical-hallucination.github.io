### Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance:

#### **1. Eosinophilia:**
   - **Findings:** The eosinophil count was **19.5% (absolute count: 2633/mm³)**, significantly elevated above the normal range (0–8% or absolute <500/mm³).
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - Suggests a parasitic infection, consistent with the patient’s exposure to endemic parasites in Guatemala.
     - Eosinophilia is a hallmark of tissue-invading helminths, including *Angiostrongylus costaricensis*, which was ultimately diagnosed.
     - Elevated eosinophils may also occur in hypersensitivity reactions or certain inflammatory conditions, but these were less likely based on the patient's clinical presentation.

#### **2. White Blood Cell (WBC) Count:**
   - **Findings:** Elevated to **13,500/mm³** (normal range: 4,500–11,000/mm³).
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - Reflects systemic inflammatory or infectious processes, aligning with the chronic inflammation noted in histological findings.
     - Elevation supports the likelihood of an infection as the primary etiology of the symptoms.

#### **3. Platelet Count:**
   - **Findings:** Elevated to **406,000/mm³** (normal range: 150,000–400,000/mm³).
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - Often seen in chronic inflammatory states and could be a reactive thrombocytosis secondary to the ongoing infection or inflammatory mass.

#### **4. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):**
   - **Findings:** Initially **177 U/L**, later normalized to **119 U/L** (normal range: 30–100 U/L).
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - Elevated ALP may indicate biliary involvement, inflammation, or other hepatic effects of parasitic infections.
     - Normalization aligns with resolution or control of systemic effects post-surgical intervention.

#### **5. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit:**
   - **Findings:** Hemoglobin decreased from **14.1 g/dL** to **13.1 g/dL** (normal: 12–16 g/dL), and hematocrit dropped from **42.1% to 39.5%**.
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - The mild decline may indicate chronic disease or low-level bleeding associated with the colonic mass.
     - Not significant enough to suggest severe anemia or overt gastrointestinal bleeding.

#### **6. Liver Enzymes (ALT/AST):**
   - **Findings:** Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased from **62 U/L** to **17 U/L**, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) decreased from **40 U/L** to **19 U/L** (normal ranges: ALT 7–33 U/L, AST 9–32 U/L).
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - Initial elevation suggests mild hepatic involvement, possibly due to systemic inflammation or parasitic infection.
     - Normalization correlates with resolution of active systemic inflammation post-treatment.

#### **7. Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA):**
   - **Findings:** **2.2 ng/mL** (normal range: <3.4 ng/mL).
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - While within normal limits, it helps exclude a neoplastic etiology for the colonic mass.

#### **8. Imaging and Biopsy Correlation:**
   - **Findings:** CT showed a mass in the ascending colon with transmural extension and inflammation. Biopsy revealed eosinophilic infiltration and reactive changes, excluding malignancy.
   - **Clinical Significance:**
     - Imaging and histological findings align with parasitic infection (*Angiostrongylus costaricensis*) causing the colonic mass and associated symptoms.

### **Conclusion:**
The laboratory findings primarily point to a parasitic etiology, supported by elevated eosinophils, mild hepatic enzyme elevations, and systemic inflammatory markers. These findings were clinically significant in directing the differential diagnosis towards *Angiostrongylus costaricensis* and guided the need for surgical intervention to remove the colonic mass. Postoperative normalization of these values confirmed resolution of the systemic effects.
