Below is a chronological outline of the patient’s key symptoms and clinical interventions, with emphasis on how various complaints and treatments overlapped or followed one another in time.  

1) About 2 Years before This Presentation  
• New-onset epigastric pain (burning in quality, radiating toward the chest, often postprandial)  
• Associated diarrhea  
• Testing in Guatemala reportedly revealed H. pylori infection, but the patient did not receive antibiotic therapy. Intermittent proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy partially controlled symptoms.  

2) 10 Months before This Presentation  
• While visiting New England, she presented to the emergency department with a recurrence of epigastric pain similar to before.  
• The pain did not improve after 3 days of PPI therapy.  
• Laboratory tests and a stool test for H. pylori antigen were negative.  
• Pain resolved spontaneously over time, and she returned to Guatemala.  

3) 5 Months before This Presentation  
• Fevers, throbbing pain in the left ear and left side of the face (radiating to the jaw), neck stiffness, and tinnitus began in Guatemala.  
• CT of the head reportedly showed findings consistent with sinusitis and left otitis media.  
• Fevers and neck stiffness resolved spontaneously (without specific treatment), but the ear and facial pain persisted and did not improve with acetaminophen.  

4) At the Time of the Initial Community-Health-Center Visit (the “Presentation”)  
• She reported a 7-kg weight loss over the preceding 6 months, attributed to dietary changes.  
• Persistent left ear and facial pain (unrelieved by acetaminophen) and tenderness of the temporomandibular joint.  
• Long-standing, dull, waxing-and-waning left-sided abdominal pain for 30 years (unchanged in quality or intensity).  
• Physical examination notable for a mild systolic murmur, normal abdominal exam, and no cervical lymphadenopathy.  
• Laboratory studies (including hepatitis and metabolic panels) were normal or negative, aside from a positive interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) for tuberculosis (obtained 2 days after the initial visit).  
• Chest radiograph was normal.  
• Recommended interventions: acetaminophen plus jaw exercises and massage for facial pain, mammography and colonoscopy for routine age-appropriate cancer screening.  

5) One Month after the Initial Community-Health-Center Visit  
• The patient returned to discuss treatment for latent tuberculosis infection, at which time she reported a 2-month history of intermittent right-upper- and right-lower-quadrant abdominal pain (i.e., pain that had started about 1 month before her initial visit but had not been discussed previously).  
• Physical exam was unchanged from the initial visit.  
• CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an irregular, circumferential mass in the ascending colon with transmural extension, pericolonic fat stranding, and adjacent enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (findings consistent with a likely colonic malignancy).  

Relationships between Symptoms and Interventions:  
• Epigastric Pain and Acid Suppression: Epigastric discomfort emerged 2 years before presentation; intermittent PPI therapy provided partial relief on several occasions, although H. pylori was never definitively eradicated with antibiotics.  
• Ear/Facial Pain and Neck Stiffness: These symptoms began 5 months before presentation, partially resolved (fever and neck stiffness resolved spontaneously), but left-sided ear and facial pain persisted despite acetaminophen.  
• Weight Loss and Colon Findings: She had experienced significant (7 kg) unintentional weight loss over 6 months. Colonoscopy was recommended but, before it was done, a new complaint of right-sided abdominal pain led to CT imaging and discovery of the colon mass.  
• Latent Tuberculosis Screening and Treatment: The positive IGRA test 2 days after the initial community-health-center visit prompted a plan for latent TB therapy. The normal chest radiograph supported a latent rather than active TB process.  

Thus, her longstanding epigastric issues overlapped with intermittent PPI use; her ear and facial pain arose months before her presentation and persisted despite simple analgesics; and the significant weight loss, coupled with a new right-sided abdominal pain, ultimately led to imaging that uncovered a colonic mass.
