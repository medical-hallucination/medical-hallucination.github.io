From the combination of (1) a bulky, ulcerated colonic “mass” on imaging and endoscopy, (2) marked peripheral eosinophilia, (3) the patient’s history of ingesting undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans in Guatemala, and (4) histologic sections revealing an intravascular nematode with associated eosinophilic vasculitis, the most likely diagnosis is parasitic infection (gnathostomiasis) rather than a primary malignancy.

** Key Points Leading to a Parasitic Diagnosis ** 
* Marked Eosinophilia
The patient’s eosinophil count soared to nearly 20%, which is highly suggestive of a helminth (worm) infection or certain other parasitic diseases. Eosinophilia of this magnitude is far less typical of a straightforward colon cancer.

* Imaging and Endoscopic Findings
Although the large, circumferential lesion in the ascending colon initially raised concern for malignancy, the endoscopic view (“nonobstructing mass with rolled borders and an ulcerated base”) is also consistent with a parasitic granulomatous or inflammatory lesion.

* Tissue Sections with a Nematode
Histopathology demonstrates a worm in an arterial channel, surrounded by intense eosinophilic and granulomatous inflammation. Trichrome staining highlights a distinct “cuticle-like” outer layer and internal organs, confirming that this is a nematode (roundworm).

* Relevant Dietary Exposure
Gnathostoma spinigerum (causing gnathostomiasis) is classically associated with ingestion of inadequately cooked freshwater fish, eels, or crustaceans. The patient’s routine consumption of boiled fish, shrimp, and crayfish from local rivers in Guatemala, plus her migratory symptoms in the past (ear, face, and neck involvement), fits well with a larval migration pattern typical of Gnathostoma.

** Differential Diagnosis for an “Inflammatory Mass” with Eosinophilia **
1. Colon Cancer with Reactive Eosinophilia: Possible but would not explain the intravascular nematode on histology.
2. Strongyloidiasis: Usually affects the mucosa and submucosa, but adult Strongyloides are very small and typically not identified as large nematodes in vessels; it also more commonly causes duodenal or jejunal changes.
3. Schistosomiasis: Caused by trematodes (flukes), not nematodes, and the parasites (or their eggs) tend to be found in venules; the histology would show eggs with characteristic spines.
4. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss): Can cause eosinophilic vasculitis, but there would be no actual worm in the lesion.

** Bottom Line ** 
Given the worm visible in the vessel, the patient’s high eosinophil count, and her relevant dietary exposure, the mass in the ascending colon represents gnathostomiasis (infection with the nematode Gnathostoma, most often Gnathostoma spinigerum).
