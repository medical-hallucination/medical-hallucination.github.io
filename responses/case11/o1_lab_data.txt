A useful way to interpret the patient’s laboratory results is to look at how they have changed over time and to correlate any abnormalities with her clinical picture. Several salient features emerge:

1. Slight Drop in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit, but Still near Normal
* Ten months before presentation, her hemoglobin was 14.1 g/dL, and at presentation it was 13.1 g/dL (reference range, 12–16 g/dL). Her hematocrit dropped from 42.1% to 39.5% (reference range, 36–46%).
* Although still within normal limits, these values have trended downward. This could signal early or mild anemia—potentially from chronic disease, early iron deficiency, or another cause (for example, low‐grade blood loss from a gastrointestinal lesion). However, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) remains normal (89 fl, reference range 80–100), and the red‐cell distribution width (RDW) is unchanged, which makes major iron deficiency less likely (since that typically shows up as a low MCV with an elevated RDW).

2. Mild Leukocytosis with a Marked Increase in Eosinophils
* The total white‑cell count rose from 9430 per mm³ to 13,500 per mm³ (reference range, 4500–11,000 per mm³), indicating mild leukocytosis.
* Strikingly, the eosinophil percentage increased from 3.8% to 19.5% (reference range, 0–8%), pointing to absolute eosinophilia.
* Eosinophilia can be caused by parasitic infections, certain malignancies (e.g., Hodgkin’s lymphoma, some solid tumors), allergic or drug reactions, and various inflammatory or autoimmune conditions. Given the patient’s rural residence in Guatemala, her consumption of freshwater seafood, and her intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms, a parasitic cause would be high on the differential; however, in the context of a large colonic mass, one also considers tumor‐associated eosinophilia.

3. Mildly Elevated Platelet Count
* The platelet count rose from 349,000 per mm³ to 406,000 per mm³ (reference range, 150,000–400,000 per mm³).
* Although 406,000 per mm³ is only slightly above the normal range, this mild thrombocytosis can be reactive—for example, in response to inflammation, infection, or an underlying malignancy.

4. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Trending Down but Still Above Upper Limit
* The ALP level was 177 U/L ten months before presentation and is 119 U/L on presentation (reference range, 30–100 U/L).
* Persistently elevated ALP may reflect hepatic, biliary, or bone involvement (e.g., metastatic disease, infiltration, or ongoing inflammation). Although now closer to normal, it remains mildly elevated.

5. Normal Liver Enzymes and Bilirubin
* Aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin have remained normal, suggesting that there is no overt hepatitis or obstructive liver lesion.
* Albumin is normal, which is reassuring regarding the patient’s overall nutritional and liver synthetic status.

** Clinical Significance ** 

* Eosinophilia and GI Findings: The most striking laboratory abnormality is the marked eosinophilia accompanying a new, irregular colonic mass on CT. Eosinophilia raises the possibility of a parasitic infection (especially given her exposures in Guatemala), but it can also occur with malignancies—including solid tumors of the GI tract that provoke an eosinophilic response.

* Mild Anemia and Inflammatory Markers: Although her hemoglobin and hematocrit are still in the normal range, they have trended down. Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss from a colonic lesion (whether benign or malignant) could eventually lead to iron‐deficiency anemia; however, it is not yet pronounced enough to lower her MCV or elevate the RDW.

* Reactive Thrombocytosis: The slight increase in platelet count could represent a reaction to inflammation, infection, or a tumor.

* Borderline‐Elevated ALP: May reflect either mild hepatic or bone involvement (for instance, metastatic disease, if this mass proves to be malignant) or other inflammatory processes in the abdomen.

In sum, the lab data (especially the new eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis) dovetail with her gastrointestinal symptoms and the colonic mass seen on CT. While one must consider parasitic infections in a patient with her exposures, the imaging findings of a transmural, circumferential colonic lesion and involved lymph nodes make a neoplastic process (e.g., colon cancer) equally urgent to evaluate. The mild anemia and thrombocytosis could be consistent with a chronic inflammatory or malignant process, and the elevated ALP hints at possible systemic involvement. Further evaluation—colonoscopy, biopsy of the mass, and a focused parasitology workup—will be critical to establish the exact cause of her constellation of findings.
