Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

Initial Phase (7 weeks before final presentation):
- Patient develops malaise and anorexia

3 weeks later (4 weeks before final presentation):
- Develops nonproductive cough
- Fevers up to 37.6°C
- First hospital admission
- Chest x-ray shows left lower lobe opacity
- CT shows left lower lobe consolidation 
- Treatment: IV cefdinir and azithromycin, switched to oral levofloxacin
- Discharged after 6 days of levofloxacin

1 day after first discharge:
- Readmitted due to persistent fever and cough
- New treatment: IV piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin for 2 days
- Switched to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
- Discharged with 10-day antibiotic course

Over next ~2 weeks:
- Continued fatigue, cough, malaise
- Daily night sweats and fevers up to 37.8°C
- Worsening anorexia
- Progressive weakness requiring assistance to walk

2 days before final presentation:
- Wife notes patient is incoherent, disoriented, angry
- Found urinating inappropriately around home

Final presentation:
- Found showering while clothed
- Taken to hospital
- Confused, tachypneic, with elevated troponin
- Required intubation
- Transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital
- Found to have multiple systemic emboli
- Eventually diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis
- Patient deteriorated and died after palliative extubation

This timeline shows a progressive illness that began with constitutional symptoms, developed respiratory symptoms unresponsive to multiple antibiotics, and culminated in neurologic deterioration and multisystem organ failure due to widespread embolization from nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis associated with underlying lung cancer.
