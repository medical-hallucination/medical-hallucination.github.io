Based on the detailed clinical presentation, imaging studies, laboratory findings, and expert evaluations provided in the case, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is **pulmonary adenocarcinoma complicated by a hypercoagulable state, leading to nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE).**

### Key Supporting Findings:
1. **Pulmonary Opacities and Progressive Consolidation**:
   - Imaging showed dense, mass-like consolidation in the left lower lobe, compatible with a pulmonary neoplasm (confirmed later as adenocarcinoma).

2. **Thromboembolic Events**:
   - Evidence of systemic embolization with cerebral, pulmonary, renal, and splenic infarcts.

3. **Cardiac Findings**:
   - Vegetations seen on the mitral valve, consistent with NBTE, supported by echocardiographic findings of friable valvular vegetations and the absence of a significant inflammatory reaction.

4. **Negative Infectious and Rheumatologic Workup**:
   - Tests for infectious endocarditis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and other autoimmune conditions were negative.

5. **Histological Confirmation**:
   - Cytologic evaluation confirmed poorly differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with immunohistochemical markers supporting lung origin.

6. **Clinical Deterioration and Hypercoagulable State**:
   - The patient exhibited disseminated intravascular coagulation, a known complication of advanced malignancy and NBTE.

This diagnosis integrates the systemic findings with the confirmed primary pulmonary malignancy, emphasizing the role of cancer in driving the hypercoagulable state and secondary NBTE.
