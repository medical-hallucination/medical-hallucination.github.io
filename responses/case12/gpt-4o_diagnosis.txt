Based on the presentation of symptoms, lab data, and imaging, the possible diagnosis could include:

1. **Lung Cancer (Adenocarcinoma):** 
   - The autopsy and histological findings indicate adenocarcinoma in the left lung.
   - The consolidations observed in the imaging studies could be linked to a primary lung tumor.
   - Weight loss, cough, and night sweats are common symptoms associated with lung cancer.

2. **Nonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis (NBTE):** 
   - The echocardiographic studies show vegetations on the mitral valve without significant inflammation, suggesting NBTE.
   - This condition can be associated with underlying malignancy, such as adenocarcinoma.

3. **Cerebral and Systemic Infarcts:** 
   - Imaging reveals bilateral cerebral infarcts and wedge-shaped infarcts in spleen and kidneys, which can occur due to embolic phenomena possibly from NBTE.

4. **Pulmonary Embolism and Infarct:** 
   - The CT scans show a nonocclusive pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarct, which can be a complication in patients with cancer and NBTE.

The key components of this case suggest a primary lung cancer with complications of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis leading to systemic embolic events.
