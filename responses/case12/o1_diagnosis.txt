Putting the clinical picture and all of the ancillary data together, the most likely unifying diagnosis is infective endocarditis with septic emboli. Several clues point in this direction:

1. Persistent Fever and Systemic Symptoms
The patient’s weeks‐long history of fever, malaise, cough, and weight loss that did not respond to multiple antibiotic regimens raises suspicion for a process deeper than a straightforward pneumonia.

2. Multifocal Infarcts (Pulmonary, Splenic, Renal, and Neurologic)
CT scans show wedge‐shaped lesions in the spleen and kidneys (suggesting infarcts), as well as segmental pulmonary emboli and evolving changes in the brain. Emboli showering from an infected valve are classic in infective endocarditis.

3. Echocardiographic Findings
Figure 3 clearly shows vegetations on the mitral valve leaflets on both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Vegetations are the hallmark of infective endocarditis and explain the patient’s repeated “culture‐negative pneumonia” and new organ infarcts.

4. Laboratory Indicators of Infection and Inflammation
Marked leukocytosis, extremely elevated C‐reactive protein and D‐dimer, and rising troponin are consistent with severe infection, systemic inflammation, and end‐organ injury.

5. Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Changes
The presence of transient ventricular tachycardia and ST‐segment changes can accompany severe systemic illness, or pericardial involvement secondary to adjacent infection or inflammation.

In short, these features—persistent fevers and pulmonary infiltrates unresponsive to typical antibiotics, large vegetations on the mitral valve, and multiple embolic infarcts—strongly support infective endocarditis with septic embolization as the unifying diagnosis.
