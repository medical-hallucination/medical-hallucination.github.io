Let me create a chronological timeline of key events and their relationships:

2 Months Before Admission:
- Baseline creatinine was normal at 0.8 mg/dL

~3 Weeks Before Admission:
- Patient's wife became ill with flu-like symptoms
- Shortly after, patient developed:
  * Subjective fever
  * Shaking chills
  * Fatigue and malaise
  * Anorexia
  * Mild diffuse myalgias
  * Reduced fluid intake
  * Darker urine
- Temporary relief with acetaminophen

~10 Days Before Admission:
- Evaluated by PCP who suspected dehydration
- Labs showed severely elevated creatinine (4.9 mg/dL)
- Referred to first hospital's ED
- First hospital admission initiated:
  * Stopped ibuprofen, aspirin, benazepril, and metformin
  * Started IV saline
  * Nephrology consulted

First Hospital Course (Days 1-11):
- Day 4: Creatinine improved to 3.2 mg/dL
- Days 5-6: 
  * New hematuria developed
  * Creatinine worsened to 3.9 mg/dL
  * Urinary sediment showed red cells and casts
- Started IV methylprednisolone
- Developed fever (up to 37.7Â°C) and leukocytosis
- Blood cultures drawn, showed gram-negative rods
- Started ceftriaxone, stopped methylprednisolone
- Changed antibiotics to cefepime and aztreonam
- Day 11: Creatinine 3.0 mg/dL, transferred to second hospital

Current Hospital Admission:
- Day 1: Continued symptoms, creatinine 3.1 mg/dL
- Started ceftazidime and metronidazole
- Day 2: Developed worsening abdominal pain and darker red urine

Key Pattern: The illness appears to have started with a flu-like syndrome, progressed to kidney injury, then developed complications suggesting both infection and possible inflammatory/autoimmune processes, with fluctuating renal function throughout the course.
