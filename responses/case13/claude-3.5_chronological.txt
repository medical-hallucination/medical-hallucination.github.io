Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

2 months before admission:
- Baseline creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL

3 weeks before admission:
- Patient's wife became ill with chills, fatigue, myalgias
- A few days later, patient developed fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, myalgias
- Patient reduced fluid intake and noticed darker urine
- Symptoms temporarily relieved with acetaminophen

10 days before admission:
- Evaluated by primary care physician for suspected dehydration
- Lab tests showed creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL
- Referred to emergency department of another hospital

At other hospital:
- Initial presentation with cola-colored urine, constitutional symptoms, abdominal cramping 
- Started on IV saline
- Medications (ibuprofen, aspirin, benazepril, metformin) discontinued
- By hospital day 4: Creatinine improved to 3.2 mg/dL
- Over next 2 days: Developed hematuria, creatinine increased to 3.9 mg/dL
- Started on IV methylprednisolone
- Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods
- Started on antibiotics (ceftriaxone, then cefepime and aztreonam)

At Massachusetts General Hospital:
- Transfer on hospital day 11 with creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL
- Kidney biopsy performed
- 5 days after biopsy: Developed severe abdominal pain and high WBC count
- CT showed diverticulitis with colonic perforation
- Underwent sigmoid colectomy and colostomy
- Developed postoperative deep vein thrombosis
- Total hospitalization >6 weeks
- Discharged with creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL

Follow-up:
- 3 months: Second dose of rituximab
- After 3 months: Cyclophosphamide stopped
- After 5 months: Prednisone tapered and discontinued
- 1 year: Successful colostomy reversal
- 16 months: Doing well with creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, off immunosuppression

This timeline shows the progression from initial viral-like illness to rapidly declining kidney function, followed by complications from both the disease and its treatment, and ultimately successful recovery.
