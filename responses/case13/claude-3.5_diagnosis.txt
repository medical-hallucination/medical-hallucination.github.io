Let me analyze this case systematically to determine the possible diagnosis:

Key Findings:
1. Patient Presentation:
- 71-year-old man
- Worsening renal function and hematuria
- Preceded by flu-like illness (possibly from wife/grandchildren)
- Cola-colored urine
- Low-grade fever
- Creatinine elevated from baseline 0.8 to 4.9 mg/dL

2. Laboratory Findings:
- Elevated creatinine (2.78 mg/dL at current admission)
- Urinalysis showing:
  * Red cells "too numerous to count"
  * Protein 2+
  * Blood 3+
  * Elevated protein/creatinine ratio (5.71)
- Positive antinuclear antibody (1:40)
- Elevated kappa and lambda light chains
- Elevated rheumatoid factor (31 U/ml)
- Normal complement levels (C3, C4)
- Negative ANCA (anti-MPO and anti-PR3)

3. Imaging:
- CT shows bilateral perinephric stranding
- Multiple renal cysts
- Evidence of diverticulitis

4. Clinical Course:
- Initial treatment with steroids
- Blood cultures grew gram-negative rods
- Worsening with antibiotics

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is:

Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis (PIGN) with concurrent diverticulitis

Supporting evidence:
1. Acute kidney injury following an infectious illness
2. Active urinary sediment with RBCs
3. Proteinuria
4. Positive blood cultures suggesting infection
5. CT findings showing both kidney inflammation and diverticulitis
6. The temporal relationship between infection and kidney dysfunction
7. The presence of RBC casts and proteinuria suggesting glomerular involvement
8. Low-grade fever and constitutional symptoms

The alternative diagnoses to consider would be:
1. ANCA-negative vasculitis (but ANCA negative)
2. IgA nephropathy (would need biopsy to confirm)
3. Drug-induced interstitial nephritis (history of NSAID use)

The presence of both kidney disease and diverticulitis suggests this could be a case where the diverticular infection triggered the glomerulonephritis, making post-infectious glomerulonephritis the most likely unifying diagnosis.
