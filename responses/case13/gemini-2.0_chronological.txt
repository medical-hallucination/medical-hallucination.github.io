Okay, here's a chronological ordering of key events, along with temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

**Timeline of Events and Interventions:**

*   **~ 3 Weeks Prior to Admission:**
    *   **Event:** Patient's wife develops symptoms of influenza: chills, fatigue, and myalgias.

*   **A few Days Later (~ 2.5 weeks Prior to Admission):**
    *   **Symptoms:** Patient develops subjective fever, intermittent shaking chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and mild diffuse myalgias.

*   **Hospital Day 1-3 at Another Hospital:**

    *   **Consult:** Nephrology consultation
    * **Labs:** Additional blood and urine tests obtained (results shown in Table 1- not detailed in text).

*   **Hospital Day 4 at Another Hospital:**
    *   **Event:** Creatinine decreased to 3.2 mg/dL
*   **Hospital Day 6 at Another Hospital:**
     *   **Symptoms:** Hematuria, creatinine increases to 3.9 mg/dL.
     *   **Labs:**  Urinary sediment shows red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts.
    *   **Intervention:** IV methylprednisolone started, plan for kidney biopsy.

*   **Hospital Day 6 -8 at Another Hospital**
    * **Symptoms:** Temperatures up to 37.7°C and persistent leukocytosis
    * **Labs:** Two sets of blood cultures were obtained
     *   **Event:** Gram-negative rods grow in anaerobic blood culture bottles two days later
    * **Intervention:**  IV ceftriaxone started, methylprednisolone discontinued

*   **Hospital Day 8-10 at Another Hospital**
     *   **Intervention:** Ceftriaxone discontinued, IV cefepime and aztreonam started
     *  **Labs:** Repeat cultures of blood and urine.
    *   **Imaging:** Repeat CT of abdomen and pelvis (no contrast) shows increased perinephric fluid, hyperintense renal cyst, presacral fat stranding, and trace bilateral pleural effusions.
    *   **Test:** Echocardiogram shows normal ventricular function, no valvular calcifications

*   **Hospital Day 11 at Another Hospital:**
    *   **Event:** Creatinine level is 3.0 mg/dL.
    *   **Event:** Patient requests transfer to this hospital.

*   **Admission to This Hospital:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Gross hematuria with brown urine, fatigue, low-grade fevers, anorexia, intermittent cough, diffuse crampy abdominal pain (rated 3/10). No dysuria, urinary frequency, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, pharyngitis, dyspnea, rash, headache, or neurologic symptoms.
    *   **Vitals:** Temperature 37.4°C, HR 84, BP 159/90, RR 18, O2 Sat 94%.
    * **Physical Exam Findings:** Poor dentition, grade 2/6 systolic murmur, bibasilar crackles, soft abdomen, left inguinal hernia, rose-colored urine.
    * **Labs:** Cultures of blood and urine, normal blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, Additional labs (results in table 1- not in text)
    *   **Labs:** Urinary sediment shows numerous nondysmorphic red cells, few granular casts, no cellular casts. Serum protein electrophoresis normal, urine Bence Jones protein negative.
    *   **Imaging:** CT of abdomen and pelvis (no contrast): mild bilateral perinephric stranding, multiple renal cysts, colonic diverticulosis with fat stranding/lymph nodes (suggesting diverticulitis), trace free fluid in peritoneum, vascular calcifications/AAA, clear lung bases, trace bilateral pleural effusions.

*   **Hospital Day 1 at This Hospital:**
    *   **Intervention:** IV ceftazidime and metronidazole administered.

*   **Hospital Day 2 at This Hospital:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Crampy abdominal and suprapubic pain, urine appears darker red.
    *   **Event:** Diagnostic tests performed (not specified).

**Temporal Relationships:**

*   **Initial Systemic Symptoms -> Reduced Fluid Intake, Darker Urine:** The patient's initial flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, myalgias) likely contributed to reduced fluid intake, leading to darker urine.
*   **Initial Dehydration -> Elevated Creatinine:** Dehydration, along with other factors, likely played a role in the rapid increase in serum creatinine levels.
*   **Persistent Constitutional Symptoms and Abdominal Cramping -> Increasing Darkening of Urine, Hematuria, Elevated Creatinine:**  The worsening of symptoms such as darkening urine, intermittent abdominal cramping and the presence of hematuria correlate with the increase of creatinine, suggesting progressive kidney involvement.
*   **Hematuria -> Methylprednisolone:** Hematuria and red-cell casts prompted the initiation of methylprednisolone, suggesting suspicion of inflammatory kidney disease.
*   **Persistent Symptoms, Leukocytosis -> Blood Cultures-> Gram Negative Bacteria -> Ceftriaxone:** Persistent fever and leukocytosis despite steroids lead to suspicion of infection; positive blood cultures led to the first antibiotic choice.
*   **Worsening Renal Function and Persistent Symptoms Despite Treatment -> Change in Antibiotics:**  Continued symptoms and worsening renal function despite multiple antibiotic treatments resulted in a change in antibiotics.
* **Abdominal Pain Worsens and Urine Darkens in Second Hospital -> Additional testing:** Abdominal pain worsening and darker urine after transfer to the second hospital indicates continued progression of the disease process.

**Key Observations:**

* The patient's symptoms evolved from initial flu-like symptoms to more pronounced renal and abdominal symptoms.
* There's evidence of an infectious process as suggested by the positive blood cultures which complicated the initial renal issues.
* The case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's kidney injury and abdominal symptoms, requiring multiple interventions and changes in management.
* The timeline emphasizes the importance of monitoring symptoms, lab values, and imaging to guide clinical decision making.

This breakdown should provide a clear chronological understanding of the key events and their temporal relationships. Let me know if you have any other questions.
