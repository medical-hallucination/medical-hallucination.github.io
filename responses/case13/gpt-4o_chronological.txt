### Key Events Chronologically and Temporal Relationships:

1. **3 Weeks Before Admission:**
   - **Wife's Illness:** Patientâ€™s wife developed chills, fatigue, and myalgias, suspected influenza.
   - **Patient Symptoms:** Developed subjective fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and mild myalgias. Reduced fluid intake and noted darker urine. Symptoms temporarily relieved with acetaminophen.

2. **10 Days Before Admission:**
   - **Evaluation by PCP:** Diagnosed with dehydration. Laboratory tests showed serum creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL (previously 0.8 mg/dL). Referred to the ED.

3. **Initial Hospital Admission:**
   - **Symptoms:** Persistent constitutional symptoms, intermittent lower abdominal cramping, cola-colored urine.
   - **Physical Exam:** Normal vitals except elevated blood pressure (153/82 mmHg). 
   - **Initial Labs:** Negative influenza A/B tests. Urine culture and other labs obtained (e.g., elevated creatinine).
   - **Imaging:** 
     - Chest X-ray: Normal.
     - Abdominal/Pelvic CT: Bilateral renal cysts, no hydronephrosis, diverticulosis, cholelithiasis, vascular calcifications, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (3.9 cm).
   - **Treatment:** IV saline. Discontinuation of ibuprofen, aspirin, benazepril, and metformin.

4. **Hospital Days 1-6 (First Hospital):**
   - **Renal Function:** Creatinine improved to 3.2 mg/dL but increased to 3.9 mg/dL with hematuria onset.
   - **Urinalysis:** Revealed red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts.
   - **Intervention:** Methylprednisolone initiated for suspected immune-mediated renal injury.
   - **New Culture Results:** Blood cultures showed gram-negative rods.
   - **Antibiotics:** Switched to ceftriaxone, then to cefepime and aztreonam.
   - **CT Scan (Repeat):** New findings included increased perinephric fluid, hyperintense renal cyst, and trace bilateral pleural effusions.

5. **Hospital Day 11 (First Hospital):**
   - **Renal Function:** Creatinine at 3.0 mg/dL.
   - **Patient Transfer:** Requested transfer to tertiary care center.

6. **Initial Presentation at Second Hospital:**
   - **Symptoms:** Gross hematuria (brown urine), fatigue, low-grade fevers, anorexia, and abdominal pain. No dysuria, flank pain, or significant respiratory symptoms.
   - **History Review:** Significant for impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, alcohol use (3-4 beers/day), and cigarette smoking.

7. **Hospital Day 1 (Second Hospital):**
   - **Physical Exam:** Elevated BP (159/90 mmHg), bibasilar crackles, rose-colored urine, no CVA tenderness, and left inguinal hernia.
   - **Imaging:** Abdominal/Pelvic CT showed mild perinephric stranding, no hydronephrosis, acute sigmoid diverticulitis, trace free fluid, and pleural effusions.
   - **Intervention:** Started on IV ceftazidime and metronidazole.

8. **Hospital Day 2 (Second Hospital):**
   - **Symptoms:** Crampy abdominal pain worsened; urine darkened further. 
   - **Further Diagnostic Workup:** Continued evaluation for worsening symptoms and renal dysfunction.

### Temporal Relationships:
- **Onset of symptoms (fever, fatigue, and dark urine)** followed shortly after his wife's illness, suggesting potential infectious or inflammatory etiology.
- **Progressive renal dysfunction** (increased creatinine, hematuria, and cast formation) preceded antibiotic intervention and persisted despite steroids.
- **Change in antibiotics (ceftriaxone to cefepime and aztreonam)** correlated with gram-negative rod bacteremia, raising suspicion for an infectious source.
- **Second hospital findings** revealed diverticulitis and renal cyst involvement, indicating likely contributing factors to systemic symptoms and renal dysfunction.
