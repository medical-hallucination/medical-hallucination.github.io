Here is a chronological ordering of the key events and their temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions based on the document provided:

1. **Initial Symptoms (3 weeks before hospital admission):**
   - Patient's wife exhibited symptoms of chills, fatigue, and myalgias, suggestive of influenza.
   - Patient developed fever, shaking chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and myalgias, with darker urine.

2. **Primary Care Evaluation (10 days before hospital admission):**
   - Patient was evaluated for dehydration.
   - Serum creatinine was elevated (4.9 mg/dL), indicating acute kidney injury.

3. **First Hospital Admission:**
   - Persistent symptoms, including cola-colored urine.
   - Imaging revealed no significant findings except for renal cysts.
   - Ibuprofen, aspirin, benazepril, and metformin were discontinued.
   - Intravenous saline administration was initiated.

4. **Progression During Hospital Stay:**
   - Hematuria developed.
   - Creatinine levels fluctuated, peaking at 3.9 mg/dL.
   - Intravenous methylprednisolone treatment began, later discontinued due to gram-negative bacteremia.

5. **Treatment for Bacteremia:**
   - Blood cultures revealed gram-negative rods, and ceftriaxone was initiated, then switched to cefepime and aztreonam.
   - Repeat CT scans showed perinephric fluid and a hyperintense renal cyst.

6. **Transfer to Another Hospital:**
   - Persistent gross hematuria, fatigue, and abdominal pain.
   - Laboratory findings continued to show declining renal function.

7. **Kidney Biopsy and Diagnosis:**
   - Biopsy revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis.
   - Diagnosis of anti-GBM disease was confirmed.
   - Plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive therapy (methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide) were administered.

8. **Complications and Surgical Intervention:**
   - Diverticulitis with colonic perforation required conservative treatment followed by sigmoid colectomy and colostomy.
   - Immunosuppressive therapy was briefly withheld perioperatively.

9. **Hospital Recovery Period:**
   - Post-surgical complications included deep vein thrombosis and wound dehiscence.
   - Renal function stabilized but fluctuated during hospitalization.

10. **Post-Hospitalization:**
    - Gradual tapering of immunosuppressive therapy.
    - Colostomy reversal occurred after one year.
    - Final recovery with stable renal function (serum creatinine ~1.5 mg/dL) and no further immunosuppressive medications.

The temporal relationships highlight that renal symptoms preceded bacteremia and were likely exacerbated by it. Initial treatments (hydration and drug discontinuation) were insufficient, necessitating advanced interventions like immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis. Complications like diverticulitis emerged during recovery, requiring additional surgical management.
