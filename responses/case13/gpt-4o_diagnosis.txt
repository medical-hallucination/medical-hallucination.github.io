Based on the presentation, laboratory data, and images, the possible diagnosis is **acute interstitial nephritis** superimposed on **infectious process** (potentially diverticulitis).

### Key Points:
1. **History and Examination:**
   - Worsening renal function with acute onset hematuria.
   - Symptoms indicative of systemic infection.
   - History of medication that can induce interstitial nephritis (ibuprofen).

2. **Laboratory Findings:**
   - Elevated creatinine levels indicating acute kidney injury.
   - Urinary sediment with red cell casts suggestive of glomerular injury.
   - Presence of gram-negative rods in blood cultures indicating bacteremia.
   - Elevated white cell count and anemia.

3. **Imaging:**
   - CT scan shows bilateral renal cysts and colonic diverticulosis with evidence of diverticulitis, which can be a source of bacteremia.

4. **Biopsy Findings:**
   - Histopathologic evidence shows features consistent with interstitial nephritis (e.g., inflammatory infiltrate).

The combination of renal impairment with hematuria, recent infection, and exposure to medications that can cause interstitial nephritis leads to this diagnosis. The concurrent finding of an infectious process with diverticulitis supports a superimposed infection contributing to the kidney injury.
