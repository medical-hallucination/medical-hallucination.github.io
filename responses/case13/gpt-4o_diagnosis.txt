Based on the provided case presentation, imaging findings, and lab data, the possible diagnosis could include:

1. **Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (TIN)**:
   - The history of NSAID (ibuprofen) use and the findings of hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction support this possibility.
   - Elevated creatinine, eosinophilia, and presence of granular casts in the urine sediment may indicate interstitial nephritis.

2. **Infectious Process (e.g., Pyelonephritis or Diverticulitis with Secondary Renal Involvement)**:
   - Bilateral perinephric stranding on CT and the history of gram-negative bacteremia point to a possible infectious etiology.
   - Findings of diverticulosis with associated fat stranding in the sigmoid mesentery suggest acute sigmoid diverticulitis, which could have systemic effects.

3. **Glomerulonephritis (GN)**:
   - The presence of hematuria with "cola-colored urine" and dysmorphic red cells is suggestive of a glomerular origin.
   - While there is no specific mention of systemic signs of vasculitis (e.g., rash, neurologic symptoms), the history and lab findings warrant considering post-infectious or autoimmune GN.

4. **Complicated Diverticulitis with Systemic Effects**:
   - CT findings of diverticulosis and surrounding inflammation suggest acute diverticulitis, which may have systemic implications on renal function.

5. **Renal Vascular Disease or Ischemia**:
   - The abdominal aortic aneurysm and vascular calcifications raise the possibility of renal ischemia contributing to the acute kidney injury.

### Additional Investigations Needed:
- Renal biopsy to evaluate for interstitial nephritis or glomerulonephritis.
- Autoimmune serologies (e.g., ANCA, ANA) to rule out vasculitis or autoimmune disease.
- Repeat blood and urine cultures to confirm or exclude ongoing infection.
- Monitoring of response to current antibiotics and steroids to assess whether the condition improves with treatment of presumed infectious or inflammatory processes.

The most probable diagnosis based on the combination of findings is **acute interstitial nephritis with a secondary contribution from acute diverticulitis**.
