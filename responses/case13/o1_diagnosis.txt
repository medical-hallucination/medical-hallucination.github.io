A concise way to put this all together is that the patient has developed an infection‐related (so‐called “post‐infectious”) glomerulonephritis in the setting of gram‐negative bacteremia and diverticulitis. In other words, his renal biopsy shows an immune‐complex GN (with granular IgG deposits and “hump‐like” subepithelial electron‐dense deposits), which is classic for infection‐related GN—even though most clinicians think of it classically as “post‐streptococcal,” it can be triggered by staphylococcal or gram‐negative infections as well.

Key points that point toward infection‐related GN in this case include:

* Recent/ongoing bacterial infection (gram‐negative rods isolated from blood; CT findings consistent with diverticulitis).
* Acute kidney injury with active urinary sediment (initial RBC casts, now predominantly nondysmorphic RBCs).
* Biopsy findings of granular IgG deposition along capillary loops (“lumpy‐bumpy” on immunofluorescence) and subepithelial “hump” deposits on electron microscopy.
* Normal or near‐normal complement levels, which can still be seen in nonstreptococcal infection‐related GN.

Although the case initially raised concern for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (with high‐dose steroids started), the negative ANCA/ANA, normal complements, and typical immune‐complex changes on biopsy ultimately support infection‐related GN as the unifying diagnosis.
