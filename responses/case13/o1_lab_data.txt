A helpful way to think about these data is to group them by major “domains” (hematologic, serum chemistries, and urinalysis) and then connect them back to the patient’s clinical picture of acute kidney injury, possible infection, and hematuria.

1. Hematologic Findings
* White‐cell count: Elevated (16,580 per mm³), with neutrophil predominance.
- Clinical significance: Points toward an active inflammatory or infectious process. This fits with the patient’s constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise) and the suspicion of diverticulitis or another bacterial infection (blood cultures grew gram‐negative rods).

* Hemoglobin/Hematocrit: Mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL; hematocrit 32.1%).
- Clinical significance: Could reflect anemia of chronic disease (given the ongoing inflammation/infection) or a dilutional component from IV fluids. There is no overt evidence of brisk hemolysis or acute blood loss.

* Platelet count: Within normal to mildly high range (300,000 per mm³).
- Clinical significance: Not particularly suggestive of thrombocytopenic or thrombotic processes.

2. Serum Chemistries and Renal Parameters
* Creatinine: Ranged from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL up to 4.9 mg/dL, and now around 2.78–3.0 mg/dL.
- Clinical significance: Indicates an acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on previously normal kidney function. The initial improvement (down to 3.2 mg/dL) followed by worsening suggests either incomplete volume repletion or a new/increased renal insult (infection, ongoing inflammation, possible obstruction or pyelonephritis, etc.).

* Electrolytes (Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻): Generally in normal range (Na⁺ 143 mmol/L; K⁺ 3.5 mmol/L), which does not rule out renal dysfunction but does not show a profound tubular dysfunction such as hyperkalemia.
* Protein (ferritin, albumin, total protein):
- Ferritin: Elevated at 603 µg/L (normal ~20–300). Ferritin is an acute‐phase reactant and can be elevated in infection or inflammation (as well as in iron overload).
- Albumin: Low (2.4 g/dL), which can accompany chronic illness, malnutrition, or an acute‐phase response.
- Total protein: Also on the lower side (5.1 g/dL), fitting with the low albumin and possible inflammation.

* Inflammatory markers:
- ESR of 82 mm/hr: Markedly elevated, again indicating an active inflammatory process (infection, inflammation, malignancy, autoimmune).

* Serologic autoimmune/inflammatory tests (ANA, ANCA, complement levels) are not strongly indicative of a classical autoimmune glomerulonephritis:
- ANA: Borderline (positive 1:40; negative at higher dilutions), which can be a nonspecific finding.
- ANCA (both MPO/p-ANCA and PR3/c-ANCA): Negative, making pauci‐immune vasculitis less likely.
- C3 and C4: Normal range, which does not support an active complement‐consuming glomerulonephritis (e.g., lupus nephritis or postinfectious GN).

3. Urinalysis and Urinary Sediment
* Color: Rose‐colored to cola‐colored, gross hematuria.

* RBC count: “Too numerous to count” RBCs per high‐power field.

* Protein: 2+ on dipstick, with a high protein‐to‐creatinine ratio (5.71 mg protein/mg creatinine).
- Clinical significance: Suggests a significant but not necessarily nephrotic‐range proteinuria.

* Casts:
- Initially, RBC and WBC casts were mentioned at the outside hospital (raising concern for glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial inflammation).
- On arrival here, mostly “nondysmorphic” RBCs and only a few granular casts.
- Clinical significance: True RBC casts typically point to glomerular bleeding (e.g., acute nephritic syndrome), but here the RBCs are “nondysmorphic,” which is more typical of bleeding from a lower (nonglomerular) source. Granular casts reflect tubular injury but are not specific.

Putting it together, the discrepancy between RBC casts (traditionally glomerular) and nondysmorphic RBCs (usually non‐glomerular) may indicate that there is at least some component of renal parenchymal inflammation but also a possible lower urinary tract bleed or a “downstream” source of RBCs. Given his known infection and inflammatory state, it is possible that these sediment findings represent a combination of acute tubular injury plus bleeding in the urinary tract.

4. Clinical Correlation

4-1. Acute Kidney Injury
* Began with reduced fluid intake and possible dehydration but evolved to include signs of an active urinary sediment.
* Early improvement in creatinine after IV fluids, then subsequent deterioration, suggests a second (or ongoing) insult—e.g., infection, sepsis, or intrarenal inflammatory process.

4-2. Active Infection and Diverticulitis
* Fever, leukocytosis, and imaging evidence of sigmoid diverticulitis (fat stranding, inflamed diverticula) plus gram‐negative rods in blood culture.
* The kidney abnormalities (perinephric stranding, complex cysts) could raise suspicion for complicated pyelonephritis or infected cyst, but so far there is no discrete abscess.
* Ongoing infection can both worsen renal function (through sepsis, hypotension, or direct renal involvement) and also cause systemic inflammation reflected in the labs.

4-3. Hematuria
* The “cola‐colored” urine is classic for hematuria. Initial RBC casts suggested an intrinsic renal (glomerular) source, but the more recent finding of nondysmorphic RBCs implies a lower or at least a nonglomerular source. This discrepancy might reflect changes over time or difficulty in capturing the exact sediment at different institutions.
* Other contributors to hematuria in this patient might include longstanding benign prostatic changes (although he had a radical prostatectomy) or an irritated lower urinary tract in the setting of infection.

4-4. Possible Overlap with Immunologic Processes
* The team initially gave high‐dose steroids (suspecting a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis), but the negative ANCA, borderline ANA, and normal complements make primary autoimmune GN less likely.
* The very high ferritin and ESR, along with infection, may initially have blurred the picture.

** Bottom Line **
* The labs show acute kidney injury (creatinine rising from ~0.8 to nearly 5 mg/dL) with evidence of both renal inflammation (casts) and significant hematuria.
* Marked inflammatory markers (high WBC count, high ferritin, high ESR) and positive blood cultures with gram‐negative rods tie in with the imaging findings of diverticulitis, suggesting that a bacterial/inflammatory process is contributing to his renal injury.
* Urinalysis initially suggested a possible glomerulonephritis (RBC casts), but nondysmorphic RBCs in subsequent samples lean toward a non‐glomerular bleed or mixed picture—likely made worse by infection and “acute on chronic” insults (e.g., dehydration, NSAID use, possible microabscess or infected cyst, etc.).

In short, these laboratory data document an inflammatory/infectious process (bacteremia, diverticulitis) superimposed on acute kidney injury with hematuria. Dehydration, possible NSAID‐related renal injury, and ongoing infection all feed into the final picture of worsening renal function and “active” urinary sediment.
