Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

6 years before admission:
- First episode of altered mental status observed by wife
- Symptoms: confusion, nonsensical speech, nonpurposeful arm movements, blurry vision
- Duration: 30 minutes
- No medical care sought

2 years before admission:
- Similar episodes begin occurring 1-2 times per year

4 months before admission:
- Episodes increase to 1-2 times per month
- Occurred most often at night after alcohol consumption
- Patient reduced alcohol intake but episodes continued

1 day before admission:
- Episode triggered by learning daughter was ill during dinner
- Symptoms improved after eating
- Patient noted he had eaten very little that day

Day of admission:
- Early morning: Patient vomited
- Throughout day: Intermittent confusion
- Afternoon: Nonsensical speech during phone call led friend to bring him to emergency department
- In ED: Blood glucose 38 mg/dL
- 90 minutes later: Glucose dropped to 20 mg/dL
- After glucose administration: Mental status normalized

During hospitalization:
- 8-hour supervised fast revealed hypoglycemia
- Endoscopic ultrasound identified pancreatic tumor
- Surgery performed: Transduodenal enucleation of insulinoma
- Post-surgery: Immediate improvement in glucose control

2 weeks after discharge:
- Follow-up showed complete resolution of hypoglycemic symptoms

This timeline shows a progressive worsening of episodes over 6 years, with symptoms consistently improving with food intake. The final acute presentation led to diagnosis and definitive treatment, with rapid resolution of symptoms after tumor removal.
