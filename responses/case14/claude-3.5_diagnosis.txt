Let me analyze this case systematically to determine the most likely diagnosis:

Key Findings:
1. 36-year-old male with episodic altered mental status over 6 years
2. Episodes characterized by:
   - Confusion
   - Nonsensical speech
   - Nonpurposeful movements
   - Blurry vision
   - Patient returns to baseline after episodes

Critical Laboratory Findings:
- Blood glucose: 38 mg/dL (severely low)
- Repeat glucose: 20 mg/dL (critically low)
- Symptoms resolved after glucose administration
- Urinalysis after glucose showed glycosuria and ketonuria

Important Contextual Factors:
- Episodes often occurred at night
- Associated with alcohol consumption
- Recent episode occurred with poor food intake
- No diabetes medications at home
- Normal liver function tests
- Negative toxicology screen

Most Likely Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia, possibly due to endogenous hyperinsulinism (insulinoma)

Reasoning:
1. The episodic nature of symptoms
2. Documented severe hypoglycemia
3. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, behavioral changes)
4. Resolution with glucose administration
5. Association with fasting and alcohol (both can precipitate hypoglycemia)
6. No exogenous insulin use
7. Pattern consistent with endogenous insulin overproduction

The most likely underlying cause is an insulinoma - a rare neuroendocrine tumor that produces excess insulin, leading to episodic hypoglycemia. The long duration of symptoms (6 years), pattern of occurrence (often during fasting/night), and dramatic response to glucose administration strongly support this diagnosis.

Additional testing would likely include:
- 72-hour fasting test
- Insulin/C-peptide levels during hypoglycemic episodes
- Imaging studies to locate potential pancreatic tumor

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this analysis?
