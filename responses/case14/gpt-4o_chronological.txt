Here is a chronological timeline of key events and identification of temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions from the provided case study:

1. **6 Years Before Admission**:
   - First episode of confusion: wandering, nonsensical speech, and blurry vision. Resolved without medical care.

2. **2 Years Before Admission**:
   - Episodes of confusion recur once or twice a year. No medical care sought.

3. **4 Months Before Admission**:
   - Episodes become more frequent (once or twice a month), especially at night and often after alcohol consumption.

4. **1 Day Before Admission**:
   - The patient becomes unusually upset and develops nonsensical speech and jerking hand movements. Symptoms improve after eating. He notes low food intake earlier that day.

5. **Day of Admission**:
   - Early morning vomiting, intermittent confusion, and diaphoretic state. Symptoms similar to prior episodes. Blood glucose measured at 38 mg/dL, prompting glucose administration and rapid symptom resolution.

6. **Emergency Department Intervention**:
   - Administration of a glucose bolus resolves symptoms. Blood glucose rises to 257 mg/dL. Diagnostic workup confirms symptomatic hypoglycemia with evidence supporting insulinoma.

7. **Post-Diagnosis Tests**:
   - A supervised fasting test reveals symptomatic hypoglycemia at 29 mg/dL with elevated insulin and C-peptide levels, consistent with insulinoma. Imaging confirms a pancreatic lesion.

8. **Surgical Intervention**:
   - Transduodenal enucleation of insulinoma is performed. Postoperative monitoring shows resolution of hypoglycemic episodes and normal glucose levels.

9. **Postoperative Follow-Up**:
   - Patient recovers well without further symptoms and is counseled about a small risk of recurrence.

### Temporal Relationships:
- **Symptoms and Oral Intake**: Episodes of confusion and hypoglycemia often occurred in the context of fasting or low food intake, indicating a strong temporal link between prolonged fasting and symptomatic hypoglycemia.
- **Alcohol as a Contributing Factor**: Episodes worsened with alcohol consumption, highlighting a contributory relationship.
- **Intervention Effectiveness**: Symptoms consistently resolved following glucose administration, establishing the critical role of glucose correction in management.
- **Surgery and Symptom Resolution**: The removal of insulinoma led to the cessation of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, demonstrating the causal role of the tumor in the patient's symptoms.
