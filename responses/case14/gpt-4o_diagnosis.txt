Based on the provided case presentation, lab data, and images, the most likely diagnosis is **insulinoma**.

Key points supporting this diagnosis:

1. **Symptoms of Hypoglycemia**: The patient had episodes of altered mental status, nonsensical speech, and agitation, which are symptoms associated with hypoglycemia.

2. **Low Blood Glucose Levels**: The patient experienced significantly low blood glucose levels (38 mg/dL and then 20 mg/dL), which improved after glucose administration.

3. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated insulin levels (14.6 µIU/mL) and C-peptide levels (3.2 ng/mL) during hypoglycemia indicate endogenous insulin production rather than exogenous insulin use or oral hypoglycemic agents.

4. **β-Hydroxybutyrate**: Low β-hydroxybutyrate level (0.4 mmol/L) suggests insulin action, as insulin suppresses ketogenesis.

5. **Imaging Findings**: The CT and MRI scans indicated a lesion in the pancreas consistent with an insulinoma.

6. **Histopathology**: Biopsy confirmed the presence of a neuroendocrine tumor, with staining consistent with an insulinoma.

These findings collectively support the diagnosis of insulinoma, a typically benign tumor of the pancreatic beta cells that causes excessive insulin secretion, leading to hypoglycemia.
