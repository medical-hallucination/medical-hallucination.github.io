Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the patient is likely experiencing symptoms due to severe hypoglycemia. Here's the analysis of key findings:

### Clinical Significance of the Laboratory Findings:
- **Hypoglycemia:** The patient's initial blood glucose level was critically low at 38 mg/dL, and later dropped to 20 mg/dL. This explains the episodes of altered mental status, confusion, nonsensical speech, and nonpurposeful movements. These are typical symptoms of neuroglycopenia due to insufficient glucose supply to the brain.
- **Elevated Insulin and C-peptide Levels:** Despite hypoglycemia, the insulin level was 14.6 µIU/mL and C-peptide level was 3.2 ng/mL. Both are elevated when blood glucose is low, ruling out the use of exogenous insulin (which would suppress C-peptide levels). This suggests endogenous hyperinsulinism.
- **Low β-Hydroxybutyrate Level:** The low level of β-hydroxybutyrate (0.4 mmol/L) indicates suppressed ketogenesis, consistent with hyperinsulinemia.
- **Glucagon Stimulation Test:** Not explicitly detailed in the data, but elevated insulin levels despite hypoglycemia may lead to inadequate glucose response to glucagon stimulation.
- **Negative Sulfonylurea Screen:** This rules out sulfonylurea or glinide ingestion as a cause of hypoglycemia.

### Diagnosis:
The findings are highly suggestive of an insulinoma, a pancreatic beta-cell tumor that secretes insulin inappropriately, causing hypoglycemia.

### Clinical Considerations:
- The patient's symptoms are consistent with Whipple's triad (symptoms of hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose, and relief of symptoms after glucose administration).
- The immediate improvement in mental status following dextrose administration confirms hypoglycemia as the cause of the altered mental state.

### Management:
- Immediate: Address hypoglycemia with intravenous glucose.
- Long-term: Further imaging studies (such as CT or MRI) to localize the insulinoma and surgical consultation for potential resection. 

Overall, the combination of severe hypoglycemia, elevated endogenous insulin and C-peptide levels, and suppressed ketogenesis strongly points towards an insulinoma as the underlying cause of the patient's recurrent neuroglycopenic episodes.
