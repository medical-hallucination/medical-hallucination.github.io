The laboratory findings and their clinical significance in relation to the patient's symptoms are as follows:

### Key Laboratory Findings:
1. **Blood Glucose**:
   - Initial blood glucose level was **38 mg/dL** (normal: 70-110 mg/dL).
   - Dropped further to **20 mg/dL** during fasting, with neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion and agitation).
   - Resolved with glucose administration (level rose to 257 mg/dL).

2. **C-Peptide and Insulin Levels**:
   - C-Peptide: Elevated at **3.2 ng/mL** (normal: <0.6 ng/mL during hypoglycemia).
   - Insulin: Elevated at **14.6 μIU/mL** (normal: <3 μIU/mL during hypoglycemia).
   - Both levels suggest endogenous insulin overproduction.

3. **β-Hydroxybutyrate**:
   - Abnormally low at **0.4 mmol/L** (normal during fasting hypoglycemia: >2.7 mmol/L), indicating suppressed lipolysis due to inappropriate insulin secretion.

4. **Toxicology**:
   - Negative for exogenous insulin or hypoglycemic drugs, ruling out factitious hypoglycemia.

5. **Other Parameters**:
   - Normal renal, liver, and thyroid function tests.
   - Elevated C-reactive protein (48 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (38 mm/h) indicate mild inflammation but are nonspecific.

6. **Fasting Test**:
   - During supervised fasting, glucose dropped to **29 mg/dL**, with symptomatic hypoglycemia and confirmed inappropriate hyperinsulinemia.

### Clinical Significance:
1. **Diagnosis of Insulinoma**:
   - These findings fulfill **Whipple’s Triad**: 
     1. Symptoms of neuroglycopenia (confusion, agitation, nonsensical speech).
     2. Documented hypoglycemia during episodes.
     3. Resolution of symptoms with glucose administration.
   - Elevated insulin and C-peptide during hypoglycemia confirm endogenous insulin overproduction, consistent with **insulinoma**.

2. **Symptomatology Correlation**:
   - Hypoglycemia explains the episodic confusion, agitation, and nonsensical speech due to insufficient glucose delivery to the brain.
   - Suppression of lipolysis (low β-hydroxybutyrate) by inappropriate insulin secretion exacerbates the brain’s energy deficit.

3. **Ruling Out Differential Diagnoses**:
   - Normal toxicology excludes factitious hypoglycemia.
   - Normal BMI and absence of weight loss make starvation unlikely.
   - No access to insulin or sulfonylureas excludes accidental ingestion.

4. **Role of Alcohol**:
   - Alcohol impairs gluconeogenesis and worsens hypoglycemia, correlating with increased symptom frequency after alcohol consumption.

5. **Imaging and Localization**:
   - Endoscopic ultrasonography confirmed a hypoechoic lesion in the pancreatic head, consistent with insulinoma.

### Conclusion:
The laboratory findings are pathognomonic for insulinoma, a rare neuroendocrine tumor causing hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The biochemical and imaging data directly link the patient’s episodes of confusion and altered mental status to periods of fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Treatment via tumor enucleation resolved the symptoms and restored normal glucose homeostasis.
