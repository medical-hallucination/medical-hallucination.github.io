Putting together the clinical presentation (Whipple’s triad of true hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenic symptoms that resolve with glucose), the laboratory data (inappropriately high insulin and C‐peptide levels, suppressed ketones), and the imaging and histopathology findings (a well‐differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreatic head), the most likely diagnosis is a pancreatic insulinoma (an insulin‐secreting neuroendocrine tumor).
