A key point in understanding this patient’s presentation is that he develops true hypoglycemia (blood glucose in the 20–30 mg/dL range) along with inappropriately high endogenous insulin levels and suppressed ketone production. Below is a step‐by‐step breakdown of the pertinent labs and how they explain his episodes of altered mental status.

1. Low Blood Glucose
* Finding: On several occasions, the patient’s glucose dropped to the 20–30 mg/dL range (normal ≈70–110 mg/dL).
* Significance: Hypoglycemia of this degree commonly causes neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, nonsensical speech, “nonpurposeful” movements) because the brain depends on glucose for fuel.

2. High Insulin Level during Hypoglycemia
* Finding: His insulin level was measured at 14.6 µIU/mL when the serum glucose was < 50 mg/dL. (For reference, one would expect insulin to be suppressed—i.e., very low—during hypoglycemia in a healthy person.)
* Significance: An inappropriately elevated insulin concentration at the time of low blood glucose suggests an endogenous hyperinsulinemic state. In other words, the body is still producing insulin when it should be turning insulin off.

3. Elevated C‐Peptide
* Finding: The patient’s C‐peptide level was 3.2 ng/mL (where ≥0.6 ng/mL is considered elevated in this clinical context).
* Significance:
- C‐peptide is cleaved from proinsulin as insulin is secreted by the pancreas.
- An elevated C‐peptide level rules out exogenous insulin injection, because exogenous insulin (the kind given from outside the body) does not come packaged with C‐peptide.
- Thus, high insulin and high C‐peptide confirm endogenous (pancreatic) overproduction of insulin.

4. Suppressed β-Hydroxybutyrate
* Finding: β-Hydroxybutyrate (a ketone body) was only 0.4 mmol/L (very low).
* Significance: In a normal fasted state—especially when someone’s blood sugar is dipping—one expects increased ketone production as an alternative fuel source.
- High insulin levels turn off lipolysis and ketogenesis, so the very low β-hydroxybutyrate indicates that insulin is blocking the normal “backup” pathway for fuel.
- This pattern is typical in endogenous hyperinsulinemia (e.g., insulinoma) or exogenous insulin administration, but is not consistent with other causes of hypoglycemia (which usually show elevated ketones).

5. Marked Rise in Glucose after Glucagon Injection
* Finding: Glucagon injection raised serum glucose by ≥25 mg/dL.
* Significance: In hyperinsulinemic states such as an insulinoma, the patient’s liver is storing glycogen but is unable to release glucose (because insulin is high). A glucagon bolus can acutely mobilize the large hepatic glycogen stores, causing a substantial jump in blood sugar—consistent with insulinoma.

6. Negative Screen for Sulfonylureas
* Finding: Urine and serum screens for sulfonylureas and glinides were negative.
* Significance: This excludes the possibility that the patient’s pancreas was being stimulated by an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., a sulfonylurea). Hence, his high endogenous insulin level is not medication‐induced.

** Putting It All Together **
* Clinical Picture: Recurrent episodes of confusion, nonsensical speech, and bizarre behavior that resolve rapidly with glucose, plus the “Whipple’s triad” (hypoglycemia, neuroglycopenic symptoms, and relief of symptoms with glucose).
* Laboratory Findings:
- Hypoglycemia with
- Inappropriately high insulin,
- Elevated C-peptide,
- Low ketones,
- Marked rise in glucose after glucagon, and
- No evidence of exogenous insulin or sulfonylureas
* Likely Diagnosis: Insulinoma (an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor), causing endogenous hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia.

Thus, the lab data explain his symptoms of altered mental status—he is experiencing true, severe hypoglycemia that is driven by excessive pancreatic insulin secretion. That hyperinsulinemic state prevents ketone production and drives his blood glucose to dangerously low levels, causing the neurologic manifestations seen clinically.
