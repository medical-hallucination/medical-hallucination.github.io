Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

Initial State (Baseline)
- Patient was in usual health
- Could walk long distances without issues
- Had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 6 years prior

8 months before admission:
- Fatigue on exertion and subjective leg weakness developed

5 months before admission:
- Intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias developed in feet

4 months before admission:
- Two lower teeth became loose and fell out without trauma
- First fall occurred in garage (attributed to tripping)
- Evaluation revealed:
  - Increased alcohol consumption (6-7 glasses wine nightly)
  - Voluntary food restriction
  - Weight loss from 140.6 kg to 128.4 kg
  - Declined alcohol cessation program referral

Next 4 months leading to admission:
- Progressive fatigue and leg weakness
- Needed arms to rise from seated position
- Three additional falls from legs "giving out"
- Two days before admission: fell while carrying groceries

At admission:
- Orthostatic hypotension discovered
- Multiple vitamin deficiencies identified
- Started on high-dose thiamine, folate supplement, and multivitamin

Post-admission course:
- Within 1 hour: Severe hypotension developed
- Antihypertensive medications discontinued
- By 2 days later: Could rise from seated position with minimal arm use
- At 3 months: Made excellent recovery
  - Walking without cane
  - Returned to work full-time
  - Orthostatic hypotension resolved
  - Anemia resolved
  - Hair regrowth on arms

6 months after admission:
- Relapsed with alcohol use
- Fell while intoxicated
- Died from cerebral hemorrhage

This timeline shows a progressive deterioration over 8 months until intervention, followed by rapid improvement with vitamin supplementation, and ultimately a tragic outcome after relapse.
