Let me create a chronological timeline of key events:

6 Years Before Admission:
- Underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery

8 Months Before Admission:
- Initial symptoms develop:
  * Fatigue on exertion
  * Subjective leg weakness
- Progressive decrease in walking distance over next 3 months

5 Months Before Admission:
- New neurological symptoms:
  * Intermittent hypoesthesias
  * Paresthesias in feet

4 Months Before Admission:
- Dental issues: two lower teeth became loose and fell out
- First fall (in garage)
- Increased alcohol consumption (6-7 glasses wine/night)
- Restricted food intake
- Physical exam showed:
  * Weight 128.4 kg (down from 140.6 kg)
  * Ecchymoses on knees
  * Gingival bleeding
  * Missing lower front teeth
- Declined alcohol cessation program

2 Days Before Admission:
- Fall while carrying groceries

At Admission:
- Weight further decreased to 124.3 kg
- Physical findings:
  * Purple ecchymoses on face and left flank
  * Brown ecchymosis around right eye
  * Reduced leg strength
  * Diminished sensation in legs/feet

Hospital Course:

Key Pattern: The illness shows a progressive course of neurological symptoms (weakness, sensory changes) combined with signs of nutritional deficiency/easy bruising, possibly related to alcohol use and restricted diet following gastric bypass surgery.
