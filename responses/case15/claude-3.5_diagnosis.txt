Let me analyze this case systematically to arrive at possible diagnoses:

Key Findings:
1. Progressive symptoms over 8 months:
   - Leg weakness and fatigue
   - Hypoesthesias and paresthesias in feet
   - Loose teeth falling out
   - Recurrent falls
   - Easy bruising

2. Physical Examination:
   - Multiple ecchymoses
   - Missing teeth and gingival bleeding
   - Decreased motor strength in hips
   - Diminished sensation in legs
   - Thin/fragile hair on arms, absent on legs

3. Relevant History:
   - Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 6 years ago
   - Recent increased alcohol consumption
   - Voluntary food restriction
   - Significant weight loss

4. Laboratory/Imaging:
   - Normal vitamin B12, calcium, protein
   - Normal brain CT
   - Orthostatic hypotension noted

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Scurvy (Vitamin C Deficiency)** based on:

1. Classic symptoms:
   - Easy bruising and ecchymoses
   - Loose teeth and gingival bleeding
   - Fatigue and weakness
   - Hair changes
   - Peripheral neuropathy symptoms

2. Risk factors:
   - Poor nutrition (restricted diet)
   - History of bariatric surgery (reduced absorption)
   - Alcohol use (interferes with vitamin C absorption)

The combination of periodontal disease, easy bruising, neurological symptoms, and hair changes in the context of poor nutrition and bariatric surgery strongly suggests vitamin C deficiency. The diagnostic test performed was likely vitamin C level measurement.

Other conditions in the differential diagnosis might include:
- Other nutritional deficiencies (B vitamins, zinc)
- Guillain-Barr√© syndrome
- Multiple myeloma
- Coagulopathy

However, the constellation of symptoms most strongly points to scurvy as the unifying diagnosis.
