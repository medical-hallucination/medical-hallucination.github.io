I'll analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

Key Abnormal Lab Values:

1. Hematologic Findings:
- Hematocrit: 36.1% (Low, ref: 41-53%)
- Hemoglobin: 12.7 g/dL (Low, ref: 13.5-17.5)
- Red cell distribution width: 14.5% (High, ref: 11.5-14.5%)
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 36 mm/hr (High, ref: 0-13)

Clinical Significance: Indicates anemia with possible mixed etiology (iron deficiency and folate deficiency)

2. Electrolytes:
- Sodium: 126 mmol/L (Low, ref: 135-145)
- Chloride: 83 mmol/L (Low, ref: 98-108)
- Urinary sodium: <10 mmol/L (Low)

Clinical Significance: Suggests volume depletion/contraction, consistent with the patient's orthostatic hypotension

3. Vitamin/Mineral Deficiencies:
- Vitamin C: <0.1 mg/dL (Markedly low, ref: 0.4-2.0)
- Folate: 2 ng/mL (Low, ref: >4.7)
- Vitamin B6: <2 Î¼g/L (Low, ref: 5-50)
- Zinc: Mildly low
- Copper and selenium: Low end of normal range

Clinical Significance: Multiple nutritional deficiencies explaining:
- Scurvy symptoms (vitamin C deficiency): bruising, gum bleeding, hair changes
- Peripheral neuropathy (B6 and folate deficiency)
- Impaired wound healing and immune function (zinc deficiency)

4. Liver Function Tests:
- AST: 79 U/L (High, ref: 10-40)
- ALT: 58 U/L (Slightly high, ref: 10-55)
- Alkaline phosphatase: 142 U/L (High, ref: 45-115)

Clinical Significance: Mild liver dysfunction, possibly related to alcohol use

5. Coagulation:
- PT: 15.2 sec (High, ref: 11-14)
- INR: 1.2 (High, ref: 0.9-1.1)

Clinical Significance: Mild coagulopathy contributing to easy bruising

Integration with Clinical Presentation:
These lab findings explain the patient's major symptoms:
1. Weakness and falls: Result of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) and orthostatic hypotension
2. Easy bruising: Combination of vitamin C deficiency and mild coagulopathy
3. Peripheral neuropathy: Related to B6 and folate deficiencies
4. Gum bleeding and tooth loss: Classic manifestation of scurvy
5. Hair changes: Nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin C

The multiple deficiencies are consistent with:
- History of bariatric surgery
- Poor dietary intake
- Alcohol use affecting absorption and intake
- Lack of proper supplementation post-bariatric surgery

These findings also explain the dramatic improvement with vitamin supplementation, particularly addressing the severe vitamin C deficiency.
