Chronological order of key events:

**8 months before admission:**
* Fatigue on exertion and leg weakness develop.

**3 months before admission:**

* Several months of voluntarily restricted food intake.

**5 months before admission:**
* Intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias develop in the feet.

**4 months before admission:**
* Falls in garage attributed to tripping.
* Evaluation by primary care provider reveals:
    * Increased alcohol consumption
    * Voluntary restricted food intake
    * Ecchymoses on knees
    * Absent lower teeth
    * Gingival bleeding
* Counseled on unhealthy alcohol use but declines referral to program.

**Next 4 months:**
* Fatigue and leg weakness gradually progress.
* Needs to use arms to rise from seated position.
* Three additional falls attributed to legs "giving out".
* Rents wheelchair due to difficulty walking long distances.

**Two days before admission:**
* Falls while carrying groceries, striking left side of face on ground.

**On admission:**
* Reports no loss of consciousness, light-headedness, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, nausea, or incontinence with falls.
* Laboratory evaluation reveals deficiencies in vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6, and zinc.

**After admission:**
* High-dose thiamine infusion, folate supplement, and multivitamin administered.
* Blood pressure drops significantly after standing.
* Amlodipine, furosemide, losartan, and metoprolol discontinued.
* Fluids administered intravenously.
* Two days later:
    * Blood pressure improves.
    * Can rise from seated position with minimal use of arms.
    * New area of bruising on arm where IV was placed.
* Diagnostic test performed (vitamin C level).

**Follow-up:**
* 3 months after discharge:
    * Excellent recovery.

    * Falls while intoxicated and dies from cerebral hemorrhage.

**Temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:**

* Increased alcohol consumption and restricted food intake precede most symptoms.
* Fall and evaluation by primary care provider precede most vitamin deficiencies identified through lab tests. 
* Vitamin supplementation follows diagnosis of deficiencies and coincides with improvement in some symptoms (blood pressure, ability to rise from seated position).
* Relapse of alcohol use precedes death.
