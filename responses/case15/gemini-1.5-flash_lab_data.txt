## Summary of the Case Presentation

This case describes a 64-year-old man who presented with progressive leg weakness, recurrent falls, and anemia. He had a history of increased alcohol consumption, restricted food intake, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.

**Key Points:**

* **Symptoms:** Fatigue, leg weakness, falls, hypoesthesias/paresthesias in feet, loose teeth, ecchymoses, orthostatic hypotension.
* **Medical History:** Alcohol abuse, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout, osteoarthritis, GERD, Barrett's esophagus.
* **Medications:** Allopurinol, amlodipine, furosemide, indomethacin, losartan, metoprolol, omeprazole, rivaroxaban, bupropion, cyanocobalamin, ergocalciferol, thiamine.

## Differential Diagnosis

* **Falls:** Accident, alcohol intoxication, orthostatic hypotension, neuropathy.
* **Weakness:** Neuropathy, vitamin deficiency, anemia.
* **Anemia:** Vitamin deficiency, iron deficiency, blood loss.

## Clinical Diagnosis

* Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)
* Micronutrient deficiencies (folate, vitamin B6, zinc)

## Diagnostic Testing

* Low serum levels of folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin C
* Normal levels of vitamin B12, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (active form)

## Treatment and Outcome

* High-dose thiamine infusion, folate supplement, multivitamin
* Discontinuation of some medications and administration of fluids for orthostatic hypotension
* Rapid improvement in fatigue, strength, and ability to stand

## Discussion Points

* **Scurvy:** This case highlights scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) as a potential cause of falls and weakness, even in developed countries.
* **Nutritional Deficiencies:** Multiple deficiencies (folate, vitamin B6, zinc) likely contributed to the patient's overall condition.
* **Alcohol Use:** Alcohol abuse can worsen nutritional deficiencies and increase the risk of falls.
* **Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass:** This surgery can affect absorption of vitamins and minerals, increasing deficiency risks.
* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** Medication side effects and other factors might contribute to falls.

## Unanswered Questions

* Did the patient develop peripheral neuropathy due to scurvy or other deficiencies?
* Did scurvy contribute to the orthostatic hypotension?
* What were the long-term effects of the patient's deficiencies?

This case emphasizes the importance of considering nutritional deficiencies in patients with unexplained weakness, falls, and other symptoms. A detailed history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests can help diagnose these conditions and guide treatment.
