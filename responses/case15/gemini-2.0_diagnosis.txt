Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and images, the most likely diagnosis is **Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy)**, likely complicated by malabsorption secondary to his gastric bypass.

Here's why:

**Clinical Presentation:**

*   **Progressive Leg Weakness and Falls:** This is a common symptom due to muscle weakness and connective tissue issues seen in scurvy.
*   **Paresthesias in the Feet:** Peripheral neuropathy can occur in severe vitamin C deficiency.
*   **Loose Teeth and Gingival Bleeding:** Classic signs of scurvy, due to impaired collagen formation in the gums and periodontal ligaments.
*   **Ecchymoses and Easy Bruising:** Due to weakened blood vessel walls and impaired coagulation factors secondary to vitamin C deficiency, causing increased capillary fragility.
*   **Thinning of Arm Hair and Absent Leg Hair:**  A non-specific finding but sometimes associated with nutritional deficiencies.
*   **History of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass:** This procedure can lead to malabsorption of various nutrients, including vitamin C, making a deficiency more likely.
*   **Dietary Changes and Alcohol Consumption**: Poor nutrition from weight loss dietary habits, combined with alcohol intake can exacerbate a deficiency.

**Lab Data:**

*   **Anemia (Low Hematocrit and Hemoglobin):**  Vitamin C is crucial for iron absorption, and deficiency can cause anemia.
*   **Elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**  Indicates inflammation and can be elevated with nutritional deficiencies.
*   **Hyponatremia (Low Sodium):** Could be due to poor nutrition and decreased sodium intake.
*   **Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):** This finding can be associated with scurvy, although it is not a specific indicator.
*   **Normal Vitamin B12:** This helps to rule out B12 deficiency as the primary cause.

**Images:**

*   **Gingival Bleeding and Missing Teeth:**  Classic signs of scurvy, caused by impaired collagen synthesis.
*  **Extensive Ecchymoses:**  Easy bruising and spontaneous purpura are common manifestations.
*   **Thinning arm hair:** Another manifestation of the condition

**Differential Diagnosis Considerations and Why They're Less Likely:**

*   **Other Nutritional Deficiencies:** While he likely has some malabsorption, vitamin C deficiency is most consistent with the specific combination of symptoms. Vitamin B12 was checked and was normal.
*   **Alcohol-Related Neuropathy:** The peripheral neuropathy could be a factor, but it typically presents differently. Additionally, the dental issues and bruising are less common with only alcohol-induced neuropathy.
*   **Bleeding Disorders:** Platelets were not low, Prothrombin time was only slightly elevated and the bruising pattern is consistent with Vitamin C deficiency.
*   **Trauma:** The falls could have contributed to some of the bruising, but the widespread ecchymoses and gingival bleeding suggest a more systemic problem like scurvy.

**Conclusion:**

The constellation of symptoms, lab findings, and images strongly point towards **Vitamin C deficiency (Scurvy)**, likely secondary to malabsorption from his gastric bypass and poor nutrition, exacerbated by alcohol consumption. It is important to remember that this information should not be used to make a medical decision. Always consult a trained medical professional for medical advice.
