Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and clinical photographs, the possible diagnosis is likely **scurvy** due to vitamin C deficiency. The key elements supporting this diagnosis include:

1. **Symptoms**:
   - Progressive leg weakness and fatigue.
   - Easy bruising and ecchymoses.
   - Gingival bleeding and loose teeth.
   - Hypoesthesias and paresthesias.

2. **Clinical Findings**:
   - Missing teeth and gingival issues observed in the photographs.
   - Bruising and thin hair.

3. **Laboratory Data**:
   - Anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
   - Normal levels of vitamins like B12 suggest no deficits in these common sources of neuropathy/anemia.

4. **Lifestyle Factors**:
   - Increased alcohol consumption and restricted diet, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies.
   - History of gastric bypass surgery, which can affect nutrient absorption.

Scurvy is associated with insufficient vitamin C intake and presents with many of these observed clinical manifestations.
