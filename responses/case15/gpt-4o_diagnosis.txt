Based on the clinical presentation, history, and provided images, the following potential diagnoses should be considered:

### Likely Diagnoses:
1. **Scurvy (Vitamin C Deficiency):**
   - Bleeding gums, easy bruising, and thinning hair are classic signs of scurvy.
   - The history of poor diet, weight loss, and restricted food intake strongly supports this diagnosis.

2. **Peripheral Neuropathy (Vitamin B Deficiency or Alcohol-Related):**
   - The patient's paresthesias, hypoesthesias, and decreased proprioception suggest peripheral neuropathy, which may be related to vitamin B deficiencies (e.g., B1, B6, or B12) or chronic alcohol use.

3. **Anemia (Possibly Nutritional):**
   - The laboratory findings and physical examination findings of fatigue, pallor, and bruising may indicate anemia due to iron deficiency, folate deficiency, or chronic disease.

### Contributing Factors:
- **Alcohol Use:**
  - Chronic alcohol use is a significant risk factor for nutritional deficiencies (e.g., thiamine, folate, and other vitamins) and can exacerbate peripheral neuropathy.
- **Post-Bariatric Surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass):**
  - This procedure often leads to malabsorption of vitamins and nutrients, predisposing the patient to deficiencies (e.g., vitamins C, B1, B12, and folate).

### Recommended Tests to Confirm:
1. **Vitamin C Levels:** To confirm scurvy.
2. **Vitamin B1, B6, and B12 Levels:** To assess for deficiencies causing peripheral neuropathy.
3. **Iron Studies and Folate Levels:** To evaluate for anemia.
4. **Nutritional Panel:** To assess for other deficiencies due to malnutrition or malabsorption.

The treatment should focus on correcting the deficiencies through supplementation (e.g., vitamin C, B vitamins) and addressing underlying factors such as alcohol use and dietary modifications.
