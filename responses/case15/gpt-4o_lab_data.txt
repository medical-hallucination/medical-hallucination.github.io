### Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance

1. **Hematocrit (36.1%) and Hemoglobin (12.7 g/dL):**  
   - **Findings:** Both values are below the reference range, indicating mild anemia.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** This aligns with the patient's fatigue and leg weakness. The anemia could result from nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron, folate, or vitamin C, exacerbated by a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which can impair nutrient absorption.  

2. **Sodium (126 mmol/L) and Chloride (83 mmol/L):**  
   - **Findings:** Hyponatremia and hypochloremia are present.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Likely reflective of volume contraction or electrolyte imbalance from inadequate nutritional intake, contributing to fatigue, weakness, and orthostatic hypotension.  

3. **Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW, 14.5%) and Reticulocyte Count (2.1%):**  
   - **Findings:** Borderline-high RDW with reticulocyte count at the upper normal limit.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Suggests a mixed anemia likely due to iron and folate deficiency. The presence of varying red cell sizes aligns with nutritional deficiencies and impaired hematopoiesis.  

4. **Prothrombin Time (PT, 15.2 seconds) and INR (1.2):**  
   - **Findings:** Mildly prolonged PT and INR.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** This could be secondary to vitamin K or liver dysfunction, though no overt bleeding diathesis is reported beyond bruising.  

5. **Vitamin C (<0.1 mg/dL):**  
   - **Findings:** Severe deficiency.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Explains the patient’s scurvy, characterized by gingival bleeding, ecchymoses, fatigue, and leg weakness. Vitamin C deficiency also impairs collagen synthesis, contributing to the musculoskeletal and vascular symptoms.  

6. **Folate (2 ng/mL) and Vitamin B6 (<2 μg/L):**  
   - **Findings:** Both are markedly low.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Folate deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, contributing to the patient’s paresthesias and leg weakness. Vitamin B6 deficiency exacerbates this and can impair neurotransmitter synthesis.  

7. **Zinc (low) and Copper (low-normal):**  
   - **Findings:** Mild zinc deficiency and low-normal copper levels.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Zinc deficiency can impair wound healing and immune function, while copper deficiency may contribute to myeloneuropathy and sensory deficits. Both are common after bariatric surgery.  

8. **Elevated Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST, 79 U/L) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT, 58 U/L):**  
   - **Findings:** Mild liver enzyme elevation.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Likely reflects alcohol use or nutritional deficiencies causing hepatic stress.  

9. **Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (36 mm/hr):**  
   - **Findings:** Elevated, suggesting inflammation or a systemic process.  
   - **Clinical Significance:** Could be related to scurvy or other underlying nutritional deficiencies causing systemic effects.

### Summary of Clinical Implications
The laboratory findings collectively suggest that this patient's symptoms—progressive fatigue, leg weakness, falls, anemia, and paresthesias—are driven by severe nutritional deficiencies (notably vitamin C, folate, and vitamin B6) compounded by a history of alcohol use and bariatric surgery. These deficiencies impair multiple physiological systems, including hematopoiesis, neurological function, and musculoskeletal integrity, leading to the observed clinical manifestations.
