Below is a step‐by‐step chronology of the patient’s course, with approximate timing relative to the hospital admission and notes on how symptoms evolved in relation to specific interventions.

1) 8 Months before Admission  
   • Fatigue on exertion and subjective leg weakness begin.  
   • Over the ensuing 3 months, walking distance diminishes, and the patient must take frequent rests because of worsening leg weakness and fatigue.

2) 5 Months before Admission  
   • Intermittent hypoesthesias and paresthesias develop in the feet.

3) 4 Months before Admission  
   • Two lower teeth become loose and fall out spontaneously.  
   • The patient has a fall in his garage, attributed to tripping; there is no head trauma or need for assistance afterward.  
   • Around this time, he reports increasing his alcohol intake (up to 6–7 glasses of wine nightly) while eating less in an effort to lose weight.

4) Over the Next 4 Months (from ~4 Months until 2 Days before Admission)  
   • Fatigue and leg weakness progressively worsen. He requires his arms to rise from a seated position.  
   • Multiple additional falls occur, described as his legs “giving out.”  
   • He notices ecchymoses (bruises) on his knees, gingival (gum) bleeding, and continues to lose weight.  
   • He declines referral for alcohol‐cessation counseling.

5) 2 Days before Admission  
   • The patient falls while carrying groceries, striking the left side of his face.

6) Day of Presentation  
   • In the clinic, he reports only mild facial pain and no headache, neck pain, back pain, urinary retention, or fever.  
   • On exam:  
     – Motor strength is notably reduced in both legs.  
     – Decreased perception to pinprick and light touch in legs and feet.  
     – Decreased proprioception at the big toes; however, reflexes are normal.  
     – Thin or absent hair over the arms and legs.  
   • He is referred to the emergency department for worsening weakness, recurrent falls, and evaluation of anemia.

7) Initial Hospital Evaluation and Early Interventions  
   • Laboratory tests show normal calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B12 levels.  
   • Urinalysis is essentially unremarkable aside from ketonuria.  
   • HIV testing is negative.  
   • Computed tomography (head) reveals only soft‐tissue swelling of the face (no fractures or intracranial findings).  
   • The patient is started on high‐dose thiamine supplementation, folate, and a multivitamin.  
   • Antihypertensive medications are stopped, and IV fluids are administered.

8) Over the First 48 Hours in the Hospital  
   • Blood pressure improves after discontinuation of antihypertensives and fluid administration.  
   • Muscle strength in the legs improves to the point that he can stand with minimal use of his arms.  
   • New bruising appears on the right forearm at the catheter site.

9) Subsequent Evaluation  
   • A diagnostic test (not specified in the excerpt) is performed after these initial interventions.

Temporal Links Between Symptoms and Interventions  
• Progressive neurologic symptoms (leg weakness, sensory changes) and worsening anemia coincided with increased alcohol intake and restrictive eating, suggesting nutritional deficiency as a contributing factor.  
• Spontaneous tooth loss, gingival bleeding, and easy bruising appeared amidst possible vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies.  
• After hospital admission, high‐dose vitamin supplementation and cessation of antihypertensives correlated with blood‐pressure stabilization and prompt improvement in leg strength, highlighting a likely key role of nutritional repletion in addressing the neurologic deficits.
