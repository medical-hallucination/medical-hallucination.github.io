A single unifying diagnosis that best explains this patient’s combination of bleeding gums, tooth loss without trauma, easy bruising, thinning hair, and fatigue/weakness is scurvy (vitamin C deficiency). Although he almost certainly has other nutritional deficiencies (given high alcohol intake and a history of gastric bypass), the hallmark clinical features—especially gum disease and spontaneous tooth loss—point most specifically to scurvy as the underlying cause of his presentation.
