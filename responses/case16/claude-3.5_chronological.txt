Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

18 months before admission:
- First detection of elevated BP (140/90 mm Hg) during routine visit
- Oral contraceptive pills discontinued
- BP remained elevated in subsequent measurements
- Diagnostic workup performed:
  - Normal renal duplex ultrasonography
  - Normal hormone levels (thyroid, catecholamines, metanephrines, aldosterone)
  - Normal echocardiogram
- Lisinopril started, resulting in BP reduction to 120/80 mm Hg

5 months before admission:
- Documented weight of 67.1 kg at clinic visit

4 weeks before admission:
- New symptoms develop:
  - Leg swelling
  - Abdominal distention
  - Intermittent exertional dyspnea
  - Fatigue
  - Weight gain of 4.5 kg over one month
  - Occasional confusion
  - Two episodes of exertional chest pain (2 minutes each, relieved by rest)

Current admission:
- BP elevated again to 180/110 mm Hg
- Weight 66.9 kg
- Presenting with:
  - Dyspnea on exertion
  - Fatigue
  - Confusion
  - Physical findings of systolic murmur, elevated JVP, abdominal distention, and leg edema

Key temporal relationships:
1. Initial BP control was achieved with lisinopril after discontinuation of oral contraceptives failed to normalize BP
2. Patient was stable for over a year until the onset of multiple cardiovascular symptoms 4 weeks ago
3. Despite previous weight stability (as evidenced by similar weights 5 months ago and at admission), there was a transient 4.5 kg weight gain during the month before admission, suggesting fluid retention
4. The recent onset of multiple cardiac symptoms (dyspnea, chest pain, edema) coincides with loss of BP control
