Here is a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
18 months before admission:

Blood pressure noted to be 140/90 mmHg at routine appointment
Oral contraceptive pills discontinued
Persistently elevated blood pressure on home monitoring
Normal workup including renal ultrasound, thyroid, catecholamines, aldosterone tests
Started on lisinopril with good response (BP decreased to 120/80)

4 weeks before admission:

Development of:

Leg swelling
Abdominal distention
Intermittent dyspnea on exertion
Fatigue
Weight gain of 4.5 kg over previous month
Episodes of burning chest pain during exercise


Evaluated in ED
Started on IV furosemide with improvement
Started on oral furosemide and adjusted other medications
Discharged home

3 weeks before admission:

Recurrence of dyspnea and fatigue
3-day history of malaise and night sweats
Admitted to hospital
Received IV fluids after developing orthostatic hypotension
Furosemide discontinued
Discharged after 6 days

2 weeks after second discharge:

Development of:

Recurrent fatigue
Fevers
Palpitations
Confusion/mental status changes
Weakness
Frequent urination and increased thirst


Final admission leading to diagnosis of thymic neuroendocrine tumor with ectopic ACTH secretion

The progression shows an initial presentation with hypertension, followed by development of volume overload symptoms, then rapid progression of systemic symptoms including neurologic and metabolic derangements over a 4-week period, which is characteristic of ectopic ACTH syndrome rather than pituitary Cushing's disease which typically has a more gradual onset.
