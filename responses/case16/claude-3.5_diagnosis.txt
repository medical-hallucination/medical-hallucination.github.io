=Key Findings:

Clinical Presentation:


45-year-old woman
Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, confusion
Hypertension (initially 140/90, later 180/110)
Recent weight gain, leg swelling, abdominal distention
Episodes of exertional chest pain


Laboratory Abnormalities:


Elevated white blood cell count (15,000-17,350/mmÂ³)
Marked neutrophilia (88-92%)
Very low lymphocyte count (2.2-3.7%)
Rising D-dimer (246 to 716 ng/ml)
Elevated glucose (260 mg/dl on admission)
Markedly elevated NT-proBNP (2360 pg/ml)


Imaging Findings:


MRI shows left ventricular wall thickening
CT shows pulmonary embolism
Adrenal gland thickening suggesting hyperplasia
PET-CT shows a mediastinal nodule with FDG uptake
Pathology shows a thymic neuroendocrine tumor (based on chromogranin A and corticotropin staining)

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is:
Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumor (Thymic Carcinoid) with Cushing's Syndrome
The reasoning:

The thymic mass shows typical neuroendocrine features on pathology (salt and pepper chromatin, positive chromogranin A)
The tumor is producing ACTH (corticotropin-positive staining), explaining:

Hypertension
Glucose elevation
Adrenal hyperplasia
Susceptibility to thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism)


The cardiac changes and elevated NT-proBNP likely reflect a combination of:

Cushing's-induced hypertension
Possible carcinoid heart disease



This represents an ectopic ACTH-producing thymic neuroendocrine tumor, a rare but well-described cause of Cushing's syndrome with significant cardiovascular and metabolic complications
Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this diagnosis?
