Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

Hematologic Changes:


Elevated white blood count (15,000-17,350) with marked lymphopenia (2.2-3.7%)
These are classic findings in Cushing's syndrome due to glucocorticoid excess which:

Causes demargination of neutrophils leading to leukocytosis
Suppresses lymphocyte counts




Metabolic Derangements:


Persistent hypokalemia (3.3-3.4 mmol/L) despite lisinopril
Low chloride (92 mmol/L)
Elevated bicarbonate (33-34 mmol/L)
This pattern indicates metabolic alkalosis due to:
Overwhelming of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 enzyme by excess cortisol
Resulting mineralocorticoid receptor activation causing potassium wasting


Progressive Hyperglycemia:


Initial glucose: 101 mg/dL
Rising to 260 mg/dL on final admission
Reflects glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis


Cardiac/Volume Status Markers:


Elevated N-terminal pro-BNP (936 → 2360 pg/mL)
Normal troponin
Indicates heart failure without ischemia, consistent with:
Volume overload
Cardiomyopathy from excess glucocorticoids


Coagulation:


Mildly elevated PT/INR (1.2)
Rising D-dimer (246 → 716 ng/mL)
Suggests hypercoagulable state leading to:
Development of pulmonary embolism
Common complication in Cushing's syndrome


Diagnostic Endocrine Tests:


24-hour urinary free cortisol: 18,081 μg (normal <45)
ACTH level: 512 pg/mL (normal 6-76)
These markedly elevated levels are characteristic of ectopic ACTH syndrome rather than pituitary Cushing's disease, which typically shows:
Lower ACTH levels
Less dramatic cortisol elevation

The laboratory findings explain many clinical manifestations:

Mental status changes (metabolic alkalosis, hyperglycemia)
Weakness (hypokalemia, protein catabolism)
Heart failure (mineralocorticoid excess)
Thromboembolic complications (hypercoagulable state)
Susceptibility to infections (immunosuppression from lymphopenia)

The rapid progression and severity of these abnormalities, particularly the profound hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, are more typical of ectopic ACTH syndrome than pituitary-dependent Cushing's disease.
