Here's a chronological timeline of the key events and temporal relationships:

18 months prior to admission:

Elevated blood pressure (140/90 mmHg) detected during a routine check-up.
Discontinuation of oral contraceptive pills.
4 weeks prior to admission:

Development of:
Leg swelling
Abdominal distention
Intermittent dyspnea on exertion
Fatigue
Weight gain (4.5 kg)
Occasional confusion
Two episodes of chest pain during exercise
Emergency Department Evaluation:

Elevated blood pressure (180/110 mmHg)
Systolic murmur (grade 2/6)
Jugular venous pressure elevated
Trace non-pitting edema in legs
Unknown Timeframe (likely within the past few months):

Echocardiogram revealing normal ventricular function, no valvular disease, and normal interventricular septal wall thickness.
Renal artery duplex ultrasound, thyroid function tests, and catecholamine levels were normal.
Treatment:

Lisinopril was initiated, reducing blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg.
Key Temporal Relationships:

Elevated blood pressure preceded the development of other symptoms.
Lisinopril treatment was effective in controlling blood pressure.
New symptoms (swelling, abdominal distention, dyspnea, fatigue, confusion, chest pain) emerged shortly before admission.
This timeline highlights the progression of the patient's condition and the temporal relationship between her symptoms and the interventions provided.
