Here's a chronological timeline of the key events and temporal relationships:

**18 months prior to admission:**
* Elevated blood pressure (140/90 mmHg) detected during a routine check-up.
* Discontinuation of oral contraceptive pills.

**4 weeks prior to admission:**
* Development of:
  * Leg swelling
  * Abdominal distention
  * Intermittent dyspnea on exertion
  * Fatigue
  * Weight gain (4.5 kg)
  * Occasional confusion
  * Two episodes of chest pain during exercise

**Emergency Department Evaluation:**
* Elevated blood pressure (180/110 mmHg)
* Systolic murmur (grade 2/6)
* Jugular venous pressure elevated
* Abdominal distention
* Leg edema

**Interventions:**
* Lisinopril administration (to manage blood pressure) 

**Temporal Relationships:**

* **Elevated blood pressure** preceded the development of other symptoms.
* **Lisinopril administration** was initiated after the diagnosis of hypertension but before the onset of more severe symptoms.
* **The development of severe symptoms** (leg swelling, abdominal distention, dyspnea, fatigue, confusion, chest pain) occurred shortly before the emergency department visit.

By understanding this timeline, we can better appreciate the progression of the patient's condition and the potential impact of interventions.
