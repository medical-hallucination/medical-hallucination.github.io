Based on the information provided, it's difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis without further clinical details. However, I can discuss some potential possibilities based on the patient's presentation, laboratory data, and imaging results.

Potential Diagnoses:

Hypertensive Heart Disease:

The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of a systolic murmur suggest possible hypertensive heart disease. This could be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, which can lead to symptoms like dyspnea and fatigue.
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):

While the laboratory data doesn't show significant abnormalities in kidney function at this point, the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of edema could suggest CKD. Further evaluation, including urine analysis and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), would be necessary to confirm or rule out CKD.
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):

The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and edema are suggestive of CHF. However, the echocardiogram results showing normal ventricular function make this diagnosis less likely.
Additional Information Needed:

To make a more accurate diagnosis, the following information would be helpful:

Urine Analysis: To assess for proteinuria, hematuria, or other abnormalities that could suggest kidney disease.
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR): To assess kidney function.
Electrocardiogram (ECG): To look for signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or other cardiac abnormalities.
Echocardiogram: To evaluate left ventricular function and assess for any other cardiac abnormalities.
Additional Laboratory Tests: Depending on the clinical suspicion, other tests like thyroid function tests, lipid profile, and autoimmune markers might be considered.
Differential Diagnosis:

Anemia: The slightly decreased hemoglobin level could suggest anemia, which could contribute to fatigue.
Pulmonary Embolism: While not strongly suggested by the current information, a pulmonary embolism could present with similar symptoms.
Other Causes of Edema: Conditions like hypoalbuminemia or venous insufficiency could also cause edema.
It is important to note that this is just a preliminary analysis based on the limited information provided. A comprehensive evaluation by a physician is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan.
