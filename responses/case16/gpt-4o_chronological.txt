Here is a chronological order of the key events and the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions for the case of the 45-year-old woman:

---

### **Chronological Timeline of Key Events**:

#### **18 Months Before Admission**
1. **Routine Appointment**:
   - Blood pressure noted at 140/90 mm Hg.
   - Therapy with oral contraceptive pills was discontinued.
   - Persistent hypertension despite discontinuation of oral contraceptives.

2. **Investigations and Initial Management**:
   - Duplex ultrasonography of renal arteries: **Normal**.
   - Thyrotropin, plasma free catecholamines, plasma metanephrines, aldosterone levels: **Normal**.
   - Transthoracic echocardiography: **Normal ventricular function**; no valvular disease or left ventricular hypertrophy.
   - Diagnosis: Essential hypertension suspected.
   - Initiation of treatment with **lisinopril**: Blood pressure reduced to 120/80 mm Hg.

---

#### **4 Weeks Before Admission**
1. **Symptom Onset**:
   - Swelling of legs, abdominal distention, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue developed.
   - Weight gain: Reported 4.5 kg over the past month.

2. **Episodes of Confusion and Chest Pain**:
   - Occasional confusion.
   - Two episodes of burning chest pain during exercise (each lasting 2 minutes, relieved by rest).

3. **Emergency Department Visit**:
   - **Physical Examination**:
     - Temperature: 36.8Â°C.
     - Blood pressure: 180/110 mm Hg (elevated).
     - Heart rate: 73 beats per minute.
     - Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute.
     - Oxygen saturation: 98% (ambient air).
     - BMI: 22.
     - **Signs**:
       - Systolic murmur (grade 2/6) at left sternal border.
       - Jugular venous pressure: Elevated to 10 cm of water.
       - Slightly distended abdomen, trace nonpitting edema in legs.

#### **Admission (Current Case Presentation)**
1. **Symptoms at Admission**:
   - Persistent **dyspnea on exertion**, fatigue, and confusion.

---

### **Temporal Relationships**:

1. **Hypertension and Discontinuation of Oral Contraceptives**:
   - Discontinuation of contraceptives did not resolve hypertension, indicating a likely essential or secondary cause unrelated to contraceptive use.

2. **Response to Lisinopril**:
   - Effective control of blood pressure initially, but no indication of adherence or efficacy in the later course (e.g., BP elevated at ED visit).

3. **Onset of Dyspnea, Edema, and Fatigue**:
   - Likely represents progressive **cardiovascular** or **renal** dysfunction occurring months after controlled BP was achieved.
   - Elevated jugular venous pressure and leg edema suggest a component of **right-sided heart failure** or **fluid overload**.

4. **Episodes of Chest Pain**:
   - Brief, exertional, and relieved by rest: Suspicious for **angina** or underlying coronary artery disease.
   - Likely represents worsening myocardial oxygen demand due to uncontrolled hypertension or new ischemia.

5. **Confusion**:
   - Could represent multifactorial etiologies: **Hypertensive encephalopathy**, impaired cardiac output, or metabolic derangements.
