** 18 Months Before Admission **
1. Initial Presentation of Hypertension:
* Blood pressure noted at 140/90 mmHg during routine visit.
* Intervention: Discontinued oral contraceptive pills.
* Persistent hypertension despite this change.
* Tests Performed: Duplex ultrasonography of renal arteries, thyrotropin levels, plasma catecholamines, plasma metanephrines, and aldosterone levels were all normal. 
* Echocardiography showed normal ventricular function.
* Treatment Initiated: Lisinopril prescribed, successfully lowered blood pressure to 120/80 mmHg.

** 4 Weeks Before Current Admission ** 
2. Development of New Symptoms:
* Swelling of the legs, abdominal distention, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, confusion, and occasional chest pain (exercise-induced, 2-minute duration, relieved with rest).
* Physical Exam Findings:
* Blood pressure: 180/110 mmHg.
- Weight: 66.9 kg; trace non-pitting edema; systolic murmur (grade 2/6).
- Jugular venous pressure: 10 cm of water.
* Diagnostics:
- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, left-axis deviation.
- Chest radiograph: Small bilateral pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema.
* Intervention:
- IV furosemide alleviated dyspnea and swelling.
- Discharged on low-dose oral furosemide.
* Follow-Up Imaging: Echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic systolic function (EF: 76%), biventricular hypertrophy, interventricular septal wall thickness of 14 mm, mild mitral regurgitation, and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

** 3 Weeks Before Current Admission **
3. Recurrence of Symptoms:
* Dyspnea on exertion and fatigue returned; new symptoms included 3 days of malaise and night sweats.
* Physical Exam Findings:
- Blood pressure: 148/96 mmHg; no jugular venous pulsation or leg edema.
* Diagnostics:
- Chest radiograph: Resolution of pleural effusions; no opacities or pulmonary edema.
- Blood/urine cultures: Sterile.
- HIV and tuberculosis testing: Negative.
* Intervention: Patient was admitted for further cardiac imaging.
* Cardiac MRI Findings: Asymmetric left ventricular septal hypertrophy (max wall thickness: 21 mm), mild LV enlargement, hyperdynamic systolic function (EF: 71%), and small midwall areas of late gadolinium enhancement (fibrosis).

** 2 Weeks Before Current Admission **
4. Post-Hospitalization Events:
* Patient was discharged after MRI findings; fatigue improved initially.
* Recurrence of Symptoms: Recurrent fatigue, fevers, palpitations, global weakness, irritability, and confusion developed.

** Current Admission ** 
5. Presenting Symptoms and Signs:
* Husband reported increased confusion, irritability, and weakness.
* Frequent urination and increased thirst noted.
* Physical Exam Findings:
- Temperature: 36.2°C; BP: 135/80 mmHg; HR: 98 bpm.
- Weight: 60.0 kg.
- Cognitive deficits: Inability to state the year or count backward by 7.
- Muscle weakness: 4/5 strength proximally in arms and legs.
- Systolic murmur (grade 3/6); diffuse hair thinning; increased upper lip and chin hair growth.
* Diagnostics:
- CT Angiography: Segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli (RLL); bilateral adrenal gland thickening.
- MRI Head: Normal.
* Interventions:
- IV heparin infusion started.
- Persistent hypokalemia treated with aggressive potassium supplementation.

** Temporal Relationships **
* Hypertension and Cardiac Hypertrophy: Hypertension identified 18 months prior to admission likely contributed to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy.
* Fatigue and Dyspnea Progression: Symptoms escalated over weeks and correlated with worsening cardiac dysfunction and eventual identification of pulmonary emboli.
* Cognitive Symptoms and Hyperdynamic Circulation: Recurrent confusion, fatigue, and palpitations were likely influenced by systemic effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, persistent hypokalemia, and adrenal gland dysfunction.
* Thrombotic Events and Adrenal Abnormality: Pulmonary emboli and adrenal thickening suggest a possible underlying hypercoagulable state or adrenal pathology, contributing to the complex presentation.

This sequence provides a framework for linking the patient’s symptoms, diagnostic findings, and treatments over time.
