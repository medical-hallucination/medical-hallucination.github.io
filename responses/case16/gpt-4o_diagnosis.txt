The case involves a 45-year-old woman with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, confusion, and significant medical findings from her history, lab data, and imaging. Below are potential diagnostic considerations:

Differential Diagnosis
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):

The MRI findings of focal wall thickening in the left ventricle (21 mm) and fibrosis are consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and a systolic murmur also support this diagnosis.
Pulmonary Embolism (PE):

The CT angiography indicates a segmental pulmonary artery embolism, contributing to the dyspnea and possible confusion due to hypoxia.
Paraneoplastic Syndrome due to Neuroendocrine Tumor:

The resection specimen reveals a neuroendocrine tumor. Symptoms such as confusion and possible hormonal effects (e.g., elevated blood pressure despite treatment) could be explained by ectopic hormone production.
Adrenal Hyperplasia:

Imaging shows bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which can cause secondary hypertension (though no evidence of aldosterone excess was noted).
Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF):

The elevated N-terminal proâ€“B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and clinical signs of fluid overload (distension, trace edema) suggest possible HFpEF.
Infective or Autoimmune Conditions:

Elevated white cell count and neutrophilia could suggest an underlying infection or inflammatory process, though specific evidence is lacking in the case details.
Malignancy:

The presence of an anterior mediastinal mass with FDG avidity points to a thymic tumor or another malignancy.
