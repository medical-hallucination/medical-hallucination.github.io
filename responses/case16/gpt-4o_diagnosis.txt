The presentation and findings in this case are suggestive of ectopic Cushing's syndrome due to a nonpituitary tumor. Key indications include:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: 
   - Hypertension
   - Muscle weakness
   - Altered mental status (confusion)
   - Fatigue
   - Hirsutism and androgenic alopecia
   - Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis

2. **Imaging Findings**:
   - Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia
   - Small areas of fibrosis in the heart indicating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
   - A mass in the mediastinum consistent with a neuroendocrine tumor

3. **Laboratory Data**:
   - Elevated white cell count with lymphopenia
   - Elevated glucose levels, suggestive of glucose intolerance/diabetes
   - Persistent hypokalemia

4. **Surgical and Histological Findings**: 
   - Neuroendocrine tumor producing corticotropin (ACTH) outside the pituitary gland
   - Presence of a mass, which is positive for ACTH production

These findings align with ectopic ACTH syndrome, often caused by an ACTH-secreting tumor, such as a neuroendocrine tumor in the thymus or other ectopic sites, leading to excess cortisol production and the associated symptoms.
