The laboratory findings and clinical presentation in this case suggest a complex interaction of cardiovascular, endocrine, and metabolic issues, with several notable elements:

1. **Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM):** MRI showed asymmetric left ventricular septal hypertrophy and fibrosis, typical of HCM. This condition can lead to symptoms like dyspnea, fatigue, cardiac arrhythmias, and confusion, aligning with the patient's presentation.

2. **Pulmonary Emboli:** CT angiography revealed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Pulmonary embolism can cause dyspnea, hypoxia, and possibly confusion due to decreased oxygen delivery, which fits the patient's symptoms.

3. **Adrenal Hyperplasia:** The diffuse thickening of both adrenal glands suggests possible adrenal hyperplasia, which could lead to hormonal imbalances. This might explain the persistent hypokalemia despite supplementation, as excess aldosterone (or cortisol in Cushing's Syndrome) can cause potassium loss.

4. **Hypokalemia and Hypertension:** Persistent hypokalemia can contribute to weakness and fatigue. It can also be exacerbated by hyperaldosteronism (potentially related to adrenal hyperplasia) causing potassium excretion and hypertension.

5. **Elevated Glucose Levels:** The elevated glucose levels (up to 260 mg/dL) could indicate glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. This is relevant considering the patient's confusion, fatigue, and frequent urination.

6. **Elevated N-terminal proâ€“B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP):** Levels of NT-proBNP are substantially elevated, indicating cardiac stress or heart failure, likely related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The patient's recurrent symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and palpitations, alongside the laboratory findings (anemia, elevated white cell count, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia), require a multidisciplinary approach focusing on cardiovascular, endocrinological, and possible infectious (given the white cell count) aspects. The interplay between HCM, possible adrenal dysfunction, and metabolic changes needs further diagnostic investigation and targeted management.
