Putting all the clinical clues together — severe, difficult-to-control hypertension; episodic hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis; hyperglycemia; muscle weakness; neuropsychiatric changes (confusion, irritability); bilateral adrenal hyperplasia on imaging; and a partially calcified anterior mediastinal mass that proved to be a neuroendocrine tumor on pathology — the most likely unifying diagnosis is:

* Ectopic (ACTH-producing) thymic carcinoid leading to Cushing’s syndrome.

In other words, this patient has hypercortisolism (Cushing’s syndrome) driven by an ACTH-secreting neuroendocrine tumor in the thymus. That ectopic source of ACTH explains her constellation of endocrine, cardiovascular, and metabolic findings.
