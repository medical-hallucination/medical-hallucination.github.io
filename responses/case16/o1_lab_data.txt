A useful way to see the “big picture” is to look for patterns over time that correlate the patient’s symptoms (fatigue, confusion, muscle weakness, weight/volume fluctuations) with key lab abnormalities (especially her persistently low potassium, high‐normal or elevated glucose, fluctuating blood counts, and elevated D‐dimer). Below is a step‐by‐step analysis tying the labs to her presentation:

1. Potassium and Acid–Base Status
* Consistently low potassium (3.3–3.4 mEq/L) despite supplementation, together with episodic metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate/CO₂ up to 33–34 mmol/L), is highly suggestive of a hypermineralocorticoid or hypercortisol state.
* In both primary hyperaldosteronism and Cushing’s syndrome, one commonly sees hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Given this patient’s other findings (see below), excessive cortisol (Cushing’s) is more likely.

2. Glucose
* Her blood glucose climbs to 260 mg/dL on admission—well above reference range.
* Hyperglycemia can reflect a stress response, but when paired with hypertension, hypokalemia, and adrenal enlargement, hypercortisolism (Cushing’s) is a prime consideration. Cortisol antagonizes insulin’s actions, contributing to elevated glucose.

3. White Blood Cell Count
* The WBC is quite high (15,000–17,350/μL) on earlier measurements, then falls to a more normal range (6800/μL) at admission.
* Glucocorticoids cause “demargination” of neutrophils (they impair adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium), often producing leukocytosis. A fluctuating endogenous cortisol level (or intermittent exogenous steroids, if that had been the case) can lead to these WBC shifts.

4. Red Blood Cell Indices and Volume Status
* The hematocrit and hemoglobin vary widely (e.g., hematocrit from 48.9% down to 36.6%).
* Such rapid shifts often reflect changes in intravascular volume status (e.g., fluid shifts, diuretic use, or hypercortisol‐driven fluid retention), rather than true changes in red‐cell mass.

5. D‐Dimer and Thrombotic Risk
* D‐dimer is markedly elevated (716 ng/mL). The patient in fact has segmental pulmonary emboli.
* Both hypercortisolism and her family history (mother and sister with venous thromboses) contribute to a hypercoagulable state. Cushing’s syndrome is well known to increase thrombotic risk.

6. Imaging Correlation: Bilateral Adrenal Enlargement
* CT imaging shows diffuse thickening of both adrenal glands.
* Adrenal hyperplasia (as opposed to a unilateral adenoma) is a common finding in ACTH‐dependent Cushing’s syndrome or, less often, in bilateral nodular adrenal disease.

7. Clinical Signs Suggestive of Cushing’s
* Persistent hypertension that was difficult to control.
* Hypokalemia and hyperglycemia (as above).
* Proximal muscle weakness (4/5 strength).
* Neuropsychiatric changes (confusion, anxiety, irritability).
* Hair changes (decreased scalp hair with increased facial hair)—reflecting androgen excess that often accompanies cortisol‐producing states.
* No classic striae in this case, but Cushing’s can present “atypically.”

** Putting It All Together **
The constellation of (1) persistent hypokalemia plus metabolic alkalosis, (2) hyperglycemia, (3) episodes of leukocytosis, (4) bilateral adrenal thickening, (5) hypercoagulability (PE and elevated D‐dimer), and (6) neuropsychiatric and muscle‐strength changes strongly points to Cushing’s syndrome (i.e., hypercortisolism). These lab findings map directly onto her clinical symptoms of fatigue, confusion, muscle weakness, weight and volume changes, and thrombotic events.
