Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:

Day 1-3 (Initial Illness)
- Day 1: One episode of emesis
- Day 2: Patient became fussy
- Day 3: 
  * Decreased language output
  * One loose bowel movement
  * Evening: Wanted to sleep (unusual behavior)
  * First seizure occurred:
    - Body stiffened
    - Head turned left
    - Staring spell
    - Arm flexion
    - Shaking movements (left > right)
    - Duration: 1 minute
    - Followed by vomiting, confusion, then sleep
  * EMS evaluation (10 minutes post-seizure)
  * Transfer to first hospital (25 minutes post-seizure)

First Hospital Stay
- Normal examination
- MRI: normal
- EEG (12 hours post-seizure): showed right frontal abnormalities
- Fever developed (38.2Â°C)
- Discharged next morning

Post-Discharge Course (Days 1-7)
- Days 1-2: Well
- Days 3-7: Progressive symptoms
  * Decreased language
  * Increased sleep
  * Decreased oral intake
  * Constipation
  * Last 2 days:
    - Mood lability
    - Behavioral changes
    - Unsteady gait
  * Final day:
    - Writhing movements after eating/drinking
    - Decreased urine output

Second Hospital Admission
- Day 1: Initial evaluation, transfer to teaching hospital
- Day 2: 
  * MRI/MRA performed
  * Lumbar puncture
  * Started on acyclovir and antipyretics
- Days 3-4:
  * Irritability episodes
  * Movement abnormalities
  * EEG: showed generalized slowing
- Day 5:
  * Apneic episode
  * Required intubation
  * Transfer to PICU

This timeline shows a progression from initial non-specific symptoms to neurological deterioration, with interventions becoming more intensive as the condition worsened.
