Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

CSF Analysis (Second Admission):


White cell count: 38/mm³ (normal 0-5)
Predominant lymphocytes (72%) with reactive lymphocytes (4%)
Protein: 29 mg/dL (normal 5-55)
Glucose: 68 mg/dL (normal 50-75)
Clear, colorless fluid without xanthochromia
Clinical Significance:
Lymphocytic pleocytosis indicates immune/inflammatory process
Normal protein and glucose suggest against bacterial infection
Pattern consistent with viral or autoimmune encephalitis


Initial Blood Tests:


White blood count: 15,030/mm³ (elevated)
Neutrophils: 59.1% (elevated)
Lymphocytes: 34.4% (decreased)
Clinical Significance:
Mild inflammatory response
Stress response pattern typical in acute illness


Follow-up Blood Tests (8 days later):


Hemoglobin decreased from 11.9 to 10.8 g/dL
White count normalized to 7,460/mm³
Anion gap increased from 17 to 21 mmol/L
Clinical Significance:
Mild anemia likely from chronic illness
Resolution of initial inflammatory response
Elevated anion gap suggesting metabolic derangement


Additional Testing:


Negative Borrelia burgdorferi antibody screen
Negative tests for:

Herpes simplex virus
Varicella-zoster virus
Epstein-Barr virus
West Nile virus
M. pneumoniae
Powassan virus
Clinical Significance:


Rules out common infectious causes of encephalitis


Anti-NMDA Receptor Antibodies:


Positive in both serum and CSF
Clinical Significance:
Confirmatory for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis
Explains constellation of neurological symptoms

Correlation with Clinical Course:

Initial Presentation:


Normal labs except mild leukocytosis aligned with acute phase
No clear evidence of infection despite seizure and behavioral changes


Disease Progression:


CSF findings supported immune-mediated process
Negative infectious workup directed attention to autoimmune causes
Positive anti-NMDA receptor antibodies explained:

Behavioral changes
Movement disorders
Speech problems
Autonomic instability
Seizures




Treatment Response:


Lab improvements paralleled immunotherapy initiation
Persistent symptoms despite normal labs highlighted need for aggressive immunotherapy


Monitoring:


Serial labs helped guide:

Treatment intensity
Need for additional interventions
Assessment of complications
Overall disease activity



This case demonstrates how laboratory findings, particularly the CSF analysis and antibody testing, were crucial in:

Establishing the diagnosis
Ruling out alternative causes
Guiding appropriate treatment
Monitoring disease progression
