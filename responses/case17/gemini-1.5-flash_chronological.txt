Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions
The emergency medical services called (10 minutes after seizure) might be related to many other events that happened before or after the seizure event, including:

Emesis (3 days before admission)
Fussy (Evening before admission)
Symptoms on the third day of illness (decreased language output, loose bowel movement)
Seizure (stiffness, unresponsiveness, staring, shaking) (Evening, third day of illness)
Vomiting (Evening, third day of illness)
Confusion (Evening, third day of illness)
Apnea (Fifth hospital day, morning)
Tachycardia (Fifth hospital day, morning)
Hypertension (Fifth hospital day, morning)
Opisthotonic posturing (Fifth hospital day, morning)
Jaw clenching (Fifth hospital day, morning)
Difficulty with bag-valve-mask ventilation (Fifth hospital day, morning)
Other findings during examinations (abnormal vital signs, abnormal physical exam findings)
Laboratory test results (CSF analysis, blood tests, etc.)
Imaging results (MRI, etc.)
EEG results
Note: These are just possible relationships based on the chronology of events. It is not possible to determine for certain which symptoms led to the call for emergency services.
