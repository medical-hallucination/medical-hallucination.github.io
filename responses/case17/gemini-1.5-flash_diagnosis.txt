Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is acute encephalitis.

Here are the key findings that support this diagnosis:

Clinical Presentation:

Seizure
Altered mental status
Fever
Behavioral changes
Movement disorders (dyskinesias)
Encephalopathy
Laboratory Findings:

Elevated white blood cell count
CSF pleocytosis with lymphocytic predominance
Mildly elevated CSF protein
Normal CSF glucose
Negative CSF culture for bacteria and fungi
Imaging Findings:

Nonspecific white matter changes on MRI
Additional Considerations:

The patient's history of vaccine hesitancy and the presence of paranasal sinus mucosal thickening on MRI raise the possibility of viral encephalitis, particularly if a viral etiology is identified.
Other potential diagnoses, such as metabolic encephalopathies or autoimmune encephalitis, should be considered and ruled out with appropriate testing.
Please note that this is a preliminary assessment based on the information provided. A definitive diagnosis may require further testing and clinical observation.
