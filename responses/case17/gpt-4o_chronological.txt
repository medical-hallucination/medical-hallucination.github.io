To organize the key events chronologically and identify the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions, the following structured timeline can be generated:

Key Events Chronology and Temporal Relationships:
18 Months Before Admission:

Symptom/Observation: Blood pressure noted to be 140/90 mmHg during a routine appointment.
Intervention: Oral contraceptive pills discontinued.
Evaluation: Persistent hypertension; normal renal arterial duplex ultrasound, thyrotropin, plasma catecholamines, metanephrines, and aldosterone levels.
Finding: Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal ventricular function, no valvular disease, or left ventricular hypertrophy.
Intervention: Lisinopril prescribed; blood pressure decreased to 120/80 mmHg.
4 Weeks Before Current Admission:

Symptom/Observation: Leg swelling, abdominal distension, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, confusion, weight gain (4.5 kg), occasional chest pain (burning, exercise-induced, relieved by rest).
Vitals: Blood pressure 180/110 mmHg, heart rate 73 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm.
Physical Exam Findings: Systolic murmur (2/6) at left sternal border, jugular venous pressure of 10 cm water, trace nonpitting edema.
Evaluation: ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with left-axis deviation; chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions without pulmonary edema.
Intervention: Intravenous furosemide administered, oral furosemide initiated, increased lisinopril dose, added metoprolol and nifedipine.
Finding: Transthoracic echocardiogram showed hyperdynamic systolic function (ejection fraction 76%), biventricular hypertrophy, mild mitral regurgitation.
3 Weeks Before Current Admission:

Symptom/Observation: Dyspnea on exertion and fatigue recurred, malaise, night sweats.
Vitals: Blood pressure 148/96 mmHg, heart rate 84 bpm, weight 65.3 kg.
Evaluation: Laboratory tests normal; sterile blood/urine cultures; HIV and tuberculosis tests negative; chest X-ray showed resolved pleural effusions.
Intervention: Additional cardiac imaging obtained.
MRI Findings During 3 Weeks Before Current Admission:

Findings: Asymmetric left ventricular septal hypertrophy (max thickness 21 mm), mild left ventricular enlargement, hyperdynamic systolic function (ejection fraction 71%), fibrosis suggested by midwall late gadolinium enhancement.
Intervention: Furosemide discontinued due to orthostatic hypotension, intravenous fluids administered.
2 Weeks After Discharge:

Symptom/Observation: Recurrent fatigue, fevers, palpitations, confusion, irritability, global weakness, increased respiratory effort, frequent urination, and thirst.
Vitals: Blood pressure 135/80 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, weight 60.0 kg.
Physical Exam Findings: Hair thinning, increased hair growth on the upper lip and chin, systolic murmur (3/6) at left sternal border, proximal muscle strength 4/5.
During This Admission:

Imaging Findings:
CT Angiography: Segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe, diffuse thickening of adrenal glands.
MRI/Venography: No head mass, infarction, arterial abnormalities, or venous sinus thrombosis.
Intervention: Continuous intravenous heparin infusion, aggressive potassium supplementation for persistent hypokalemia.
Temporal Relationships:
Persistent hypertension (despite initial lisinopril response) likely contributed to cardiac remodeling (biventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis).
Symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, leg swelling) corresponded to pleural effusions and hyperdynamic cardiac function. Interventions reduced symptoms temporarily.
Recurrent symptoms (fatigue, fevers, confusion, irritability) aligned with worsening systemic issues (e.g., pulmonary embolism, adrenal thickening), despite earlier interventions.
Final diagnostic and therapeutic focus included addressing emboli and correcting hypokalemia, suggesting multifactorial pathology potentially involving endocrine or cardiac complications.
This timeline highlights the interplay between diagnostic findings, clinical presentations, and therapeutic responses.
