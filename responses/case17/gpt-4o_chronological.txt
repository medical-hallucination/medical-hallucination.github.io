   - **Discharge:** Sent home after observation.

4. **Post-Discharge Period (1 Week After Discharge):**
   - **First 2 Days After Discharge:** Patient was reportedly well.  
   - **Next 5 Days:** Progressive worsening of symptoms:  
     - **Neurological and Behavioral Changes:**  
       - Decreased language output.  
       - Increased sleep (most of the day).  
       - Decreased oral intake.  
       - Constipation unrelieved by polyethylene glycol.  
       - Mood lability, including periods of rage, hysterical laughter, and aggression.  
       - Loss of interest in usual activities, babbling, and repeating unusual phrases.  
     - **Motor and Gait Symptoms:**  
       - Unsteady gait with frequent tripping.  
       - Writhing movements after eating or drinking.  
     - **Other:** Decreased urine output.  
   - **Return to Emergency Department:**  
     - Somnolent, flat affect, and subdued behavior.  
     - Weight decreased (14.7 kg, 48th percentile).  
   - **Findings:**  
     - Oral mucosa dry.  
     - Abdominal radiograph: Feces in the colon, no obstruction.  
     - Blood glucose: 76 mg/dL (normal).  
   - **Intervention:**  
     - Intravenous fluids (normal saline).  
     - Transferred to a tertiary care center.

5. **Hospital Admission (Second Time):**
   - **Day 1:**  
     - Somnolent but arousable.  
     - Unintelligible speech and unsteady gait.  
     - Administered a sodium phosphate enema, with a large bowel movement.  

   - **Day 2:**  
     - MRI findings: Scattered, nonspecific hyperintense foci in the white matter.  
     - CSF analysis: Elevated white-cell count, predominantly lymphocytes.  
     - Intravenous fluids, acyclovir, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen started.  

   - **Days 3-4:**  
     - New neurological symptoms:  
       - Irritability, thrashing, screaming.  
       - Stereotyped arm movements, athetoid hand movements, and orofacial dyskinesias.  
     - **Video EEG:**  
       - Generalized polymorphic slowing of resting background (2–5 Hz).  
       - No EEG correlate for abnormal movements.  

6. **Day 5 (Morning):**
   - **Symptom Progression:**  
     - Apnea, tachycardia, hypertension, opisthotonic posturing, jaw clenching.  
   - **Intervention:**

     - Transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU).
