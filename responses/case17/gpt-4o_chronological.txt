Chronology of Key Events
Preceding Symptoms:

Day -3: Vomiting began, with no other reported symptoms.
Day -2: The child became fussy.
Day -1: Decreased language output, one loose bowel movement, and unusual sleep behavior.
Seizure and Initial Examination:

Day 0: The child had a seizure involving whole-body stiffening, arm/leg shaking (greater on the left), vomiting, and confusion post-event. Emergency services were called.
Examination: Normal vital signs and physical exam at an external emergency department. Ondansetron was administered for vomiting.
Transfer and Evaluation:

Early Day 1: Transferred to the main hospital. MRI of the head showed no abnormalities, but EEG showed right frontal abnormalities.
Day 1 Afternoon: Fever (38.2°C) developed; acetaminophen was given, and the patient was observed overnight. No additional seizures occurred, and he was discharged the next day.
Symptom Progression Post-Discharge:

Days 2–7: Initially well for two days, then developed:
Decreased language output and lethargy.
Labile mood, aggressive and hysterical laughing episodes.
Constipation, decreased oral intake, and urine output.
Day 7: Abnormal movements post-eating and unsteady gait prompted a return to the emergency department.
Second Admission:

Examination: Normal vitals but a flat affect and somnolence. Tests revealed no immediate abnormalities, but CSF analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis.
Hospital Days 3-4: Movement disorders (orofacial dyskinesias and arm movements) became apparent. EEG abnormalities suggested encephalitis. Acyclovir and acetaminophen/ibuprofen were initiated.
Day 5: Severe symptoms including apnea and opisthotonic posturing led to ICU admission and intubation.
Definitive Diagnosis and Interventions:

Day 6 Onwards:
Confirmatory testing revealed anti-NMDA receptor antibodies.
Treatments included IV methylprednisolone, IVIG, rituximab, and later ketogenic diet and antiseizure medications.
Hospital Course and Discharge:

Persistent refractory seizures and complications like autonomic dysfunction led to multiple adjustments in therapy.
Hospital Day 90: Discharged to rehabilitation after 3 months of hospitalization.
Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions
Seizure (Day 0) was promptly addressed with examination, supportive care, and ondansetron.
Fever and EEG findings (Day 1) prompted observation and later discharge.
Worsening symptoms post-discharge (Days 2–7) highlighted a need for further evaluation, leading to the diagnosis of encephalitis on second admission.
Targeted therapies (IVIG, corticosteroids) followed confirmation of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis but required escalation due to refractory symptoms.
Long-term Rehabilitation: Functional improvements were gradual after intensive supportive care and therapy.
