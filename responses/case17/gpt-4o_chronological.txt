2. Later:
* Symptom: Fever (38.2°C).
* Intervention: Acetaminophen administered.
* Outcome: No further seizures during observation overnight.
3. Discharge:
* Discharged the following morning after no seizure activity.

* Quiet, flat affect, subdued behavior, somnolent during examination.
* Vital signs normal; oral mucosa dry; abdomen soft with normal bowel sounds.
* Unsteady and ataxic gait.
* Blood glucose: 76 mg/dL.

2. Imaging:

** Days 9-10 **
* Symptoms:
- Episodes of irritability, thrashing, screaming.
- Stereotyped arm movements, athetoid hand movements, orofacial dyskinesias.
- Video EEG: Generalized polymorphic slowing (2–5 Hz); no EEG correlate for abnormal movements.

* Interventions:
- Intravenous fluids, acyclovir, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen administered.

** Day 11 (Fifth Hospital Day) **
1. Critical Event:
* Apnea, tachycardia, hypertension, opisthotonic posturing, jaw clenching.
