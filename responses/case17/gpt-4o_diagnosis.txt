Based on the provided case presentation, clinical findings, lab data, and MRI images, the most probable diagnosis is anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This is suggested by the rapid onset of symptoms such as:

- Seizures
- Psychiatric symptoms (aggressive behavior, unprovoked laughter)
- Speech dysfunction (decreased language output)
- Movement disorders (athetoid movements, orofacial dyskinesias)
- Autonomic instability (episodes of apnea, tachycardia, hypertension)
  
The cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows pleocytosis, and the EEG reveals abnormal slowing and sharp wave discharges, supporting the diagnosis. The absence of other disorders like CNS infections or metabolic disorders further aligns with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.
