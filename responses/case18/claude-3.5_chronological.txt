Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
~13 years before admission (Past Medical History):

Patient had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
Found to have multivessel coronary artery disease
Underwent CABG surgery with multiple grafts including saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery

Night before admission (Acute Event):

Patient drank 12 beers
Later that night:

Stood up to walk to bathroom
Wife heard thud and found him on floor with facial trauma
Patient appeared gray
Wife performed chest compressions for a few seconds
Patient regained consciousness



Immediate evaluation by EMS:

Patient was awake and alert
Heart rate 50 beats/min
BP 65/40 mmHg
ECG showed ST-segment depressions
Patient initially refused care but stumbled when standing

Hospital Course:

Initial evaluation and imaging revealed:

Two large aneurysmal segments of saphenous vein graft compressing right heart
Evidence of hemodynamic compromise


Surgical intervention:

Removal of aneurysmal segments
New saphenous vein graft placed to posterior descending artery



Follow-up:

Did well for 4.5 years
Then presented with presyncope during alcohol/opiate use
Found to have ventricular ectopy and coronary disease progression
Underwent staged percutaneous intervention
Implantable loop recorder placed
No arrhythmias detected after 1 year of follow-up

The case demonstrates how the acute syncope was likely precipitated by the combination of alcohol use, medications (furosemide), and structural compression from the saphenous vein graft aneurysms that had developed over the 13 years since the original CABG.
