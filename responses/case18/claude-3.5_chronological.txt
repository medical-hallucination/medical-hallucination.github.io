I'll help you order the key events chronologically and identify the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions. Here's a detailed timeline:

1. 13 Years Prior to Admission:
- Patient experiences out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
- Diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease
- Undergoes coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG)
- Remains active and symptom-free, working full-time

2. Night Before Hospital Admission:
- Patient consumes 12 beers
- While standing to use the bathroom, he collapses
- Wife finds him on the bedroom floor with facial trauma
- Wife begins chest compressions
- Patient regains consciousness within seconds

3. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Arrival:
- Patient is awake and alert
- Initial vital signs:
  * Heart rate: 50 beats per minute
  * Blood pressure: 65/40 mm Hg
  * Blood glucose: 98 mg/dl
- ECG shows horizontal ST-segment depression of 1 mm in inferior leads
- Patient initially refuses medical care
- Stumbles when standing, leading to hospital transport

4. Hospital Emergency Department Admission:
- Receives initial assessments
- Given aspirin and intravenous heparin
- Admitted to cardiology service
- Comprehensive examination and laboratory tests performed

Temporal Relationships and Observations:
- Acute Event Trigger: High alcohol consumption (12 beers) appears to be associated with the syncope episode
- Rapid Recovery: Patient regained consciousness quickly after chest compressions
- Medical Interventions: Immediate administration of aspirin and heparin upon hospital admission
- Pre-existing Conditions: Long-standing coronary artery disease, history of CABG, and chronic alcohol use likely contributed to the medical complexity

Laboratory Findings of Note:
- Extremely high blood alcohol level: 2347 mg/liter (well above toxic threshold)
- Slight troponin elevation
- Elevated creatine kinase levels

This chronological breakdown highlights the progression of events from the patient's long-term medical history to the acute episode and subsequent medical intervention.
