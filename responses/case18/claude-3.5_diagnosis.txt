Based on the clinical presentation and available data, this appears to be a case of saphenous vein graft aneurysm causing compression of the right atrium and tricuspid annulus, leading to syncope. Let me break down the key findings that support this diagnosis:
Key Clinical Points:

History of CABG 13 years ago with saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery
Presentation with syncope and hypotension (BP 65/40 mmHg)
No clear cardiac symptoms prior to this event

Imaging Findings:

Cardiac MRI shows:


Two aneurysmal segments (superior and inferior) with heterogeneous signal intensity
Evidence of thrombus formation
Compression of right atrial structures


Echocardiogram demonstrates:


Two masses abutting the tricuspid annulus
Compression of the right atrium
Complex internal structure with heterogeneous echotexture


Coronary angiogram reveals:


Large proximal aneurysmal segment
Second distal aneurysmal segment
Poor but intact distal flow

Laboratory Findings:

Mild troponin elevation (0.04 ng/mL)
Elevated ethanol level (2347 mg/L)
Elevated creatine kinase (887 U/L) and CK-MB (7.8 ng/ml)

The pathological discussion confirms this diagnosis, noting:

Surgical removal of two large aneurysmal areas of the saphenous vein graft
Histological evidence of atherosclerosis
Organizing thrombus in the lumen
Infiltration by macrophages and scarring in the medial layer

The patient's syncope was likely caused by right-sided cardiac compression from the aneurysmal saphenous vein graft, leading to decreased venous return and subsequent hypotension. This represents a rare but serious late complication of coronary artery bypass surgery.
