Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:
Electrolyte/Metabolic Abnormalities:

Sodium: 129 mmol/L (Low, normal 135-145)


Hyponatremia likely due to:

Recent alcohol consumption
Diuretic (furosemide) use
Could contribute to symptoms via fluid/electrolyte imbalance




Potassium: 3.1 mmol/L (Low, normal 3.4-4.8)


Hypokalemia likely from:

Diuretic use
Alcohol consumption
Could increase risk of arrhythmias




Magnesium: 1.5 mg/dL (Low, normal 1.7-2.4)


Common with alcohol use
Could increase arrhythmia risk

Cardiac Markers:

Troponin:


Initial: 0.04 ng/mL (Slightly elevated)
9 hours later: 0.03 ng/mL
Minimal elevation suggests mild cardiac stress/ischemia


Creatine Kinase: 887 U/L (Elevated, normal 60-400)


Elevated likely due to:

Recent fall with trauma
Possible muscle injury
Some cardiac contribution



Alcohol Level:

Ethanol: 2347 mg/L (Toxic >1000)
Significantly elevated
Contributes to:

Vasodilation
Volume depletion
Electrolyte disturbances



Liver Function:

AST: 60 U/L (Elevated)
ALT: 38 U/L (Normal)
Pattern suggests:

Possible alcohol effect
Some muscle injury contribution



Clinical Significance:

The laboratory findings support multiple contributing factors to syncope:

Volume/electrolyte depletion
Alcohol intoxication
Mild cardiac stress


The combination of:

Electrolyte abnormalities
Alcohol effect
Structural heart compression (from aneurysm)
Created perfect conditions for syncope


The relatively normal cardiac markers suggest mechanical compression from the aneurysm rather than acute coronary syndrome was the primary issue
The laboratory findings helped guide initial management:

Fluid/electrolyte replacement
Cardiac monitoring
Further cardiac imaging



This pattern of abnormalities is consistent with the final diagnosis of syncope due to right heart compression by saphenous vein graft aneurysm, exacerbated by alcohol use and medication effects.
