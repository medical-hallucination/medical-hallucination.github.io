Here's the chronological order of key events and temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions, based on the provided case information:

Blood glucose: 98 mg/dl
ECG: Horizontal ST-segment depression in inferior leads
Hospital admission:

Aspirin and intravenous heparin administered
Imaging studies performed
Temporal Relationships:

Alcohol consumption preceded the syncopal episode.
Syncope led to facial trauma and brief loss of consciousness.
Chest compressions were initiated immediately after syncope.
EMS evaluation occurred shortly after regaining consciousness.
Hospital admission and treatment followed the EMS evaluation.
Please note that the exact timing of some events (e.g., the onset of ST-segment depression) may not be precisely defined in the case. However, the overall chronological sequence and temporal relationships between key events and interventions are clear.
