Based on the information presented in the case, the most likely diagnosis is acute alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

Here are some key points that support this diagnosis:

Patient History:

Long-term history of heavy alcohol consumption (8-12 beers daily)
Recent alcohol withdrawal symptoms after knee replacement surgery
History of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac arrest
Physical Exam Findings:

Elevated heart rate (68 bpm)
Low blood pressure (100/60 mmHg)
Sinus rhythm with borderline first-degree atrioventricular block
J-point elevation on ECG (suggestive of ischemia)
Laboratory Findings:

Elevated ethanol level (2347 mg/liter)
Elevated troponin level (0.04 ng/ml)
Elevated creatine kinase level (887 U/liter)
Elevated creatine kinase isoenzymes level (7.8 ng/ml)
Imaging Findings:

Echocardiogram likely showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (although not explicitly mentioned in the case)
Acute alcoholic cardiomyopathy is a condition that can develop rapidly in individuals with heavy alcohol use. It can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. The patient's history of alcohol abuse, recent syncopal episode, and abnormal cardiac biomarkers are highly suggestive of this diagnosis.

It's important to note that further evaluation and testing (such as echocardiogram and cardiac MRI) would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the heart damage.
