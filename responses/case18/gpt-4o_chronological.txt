### Chronology of Key Events and Temporal Relationships

1. **13 Years Before Admission:**
   - The patient suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and was diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease.
   - Underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with grafts to three coronary arteries.

2. **Interim Period:**
   - Patient remained active, symptom-free, and under regular care by a cardiologist.
   - Statin therapy was stopped 3 months prior due to elevated creatine kinase levels.
   - History of alcohol consumption (8â€“12 beers daily) and smoking (former smoker with a 35-pack-year history).
   - Recent knee replacement surgery 9 months earlier for osteoarthritis.

3. **Night Before Admission:**
   - Consumed 12 beers.
   - Experienced a syncopal episode while standing, resulting in a fall with facial trauma.
   - Wife initiated chest compressions after finding him unresponsive, gray in appearance.
   - Regained consciousness within seconds of chest compressions.
   - No prodromal symptoms reported; possible urinary incontinence noted.

4. **Pre-Hospital Evaluation:**
   - Emergency medical services found him awake and alert but with no recollection of events leading to their arrival.
   - Vital signs: heart rate 50 bpm, blood pressure 65/40 mm Hg, and blood glucose 98 mg/dl.
   - Refused transport initially but was taken to the hospital after stumbling on standing.

5. **Emergency Department Admission:**
   - Reported no chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or dizziness.
   - Physical examination was notable for abrasions on the forehead and mild bilateral lower leg varicosities.
   - Vitals improved: BP 100/60 mm Hg, HR 68 bpm.
   - Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, borderline first-degree AV block, and a left atrial abnormality without acute ischemic changes.
   - Received aspirin and intravenous heparin.
   - Imaging studies were ordered.

6. **Laboratory and Diagnostic Findings:**
   - Hyponatremia (129 mmol/l), hypokalemia (3.1 mmol/l), and hypomagnesemia (1.5 mg/dl).
   - Elevated ethanol level (2347 mg/l) and mildly elevated lipase (128 U/l).
   - Troponin slightly elevated (0.04 ng/ml, decreased to 0.03 ng/ml after 9 hours).
   - Creatine kinase and CK isoenzymes elevated at 9 hours after presentation.

### Temporal Relationships:
- The patient's syncope occurred after heavy alcohol consumption, which likely exacerbated pre-existing cardiovascular and electrolyte imbalances.
- Post-syncopal chest compressions and initial hypotension suggested transient hypoperfusion and possible arrhythmic events.
- Normalization of vital signs and absence of ischemic ECG changes indicated stabilization post-intervention in the ED.
- Laboratory findings (electrolyte abnormalities, elevated ethanol, and lipase) pointed to contributing factors to the syncope and potential systemic effects of chronic alcohol use.

This sequence highlights the interplay between chronic comorbidities, acute alcohol intoxication, and subsequent syncopal episode with hemodynamic and neurologic effects.
