13 Years Prior to Admission:

The patient experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and was diagnosed with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) involving multiple grafts (left internal mammary artery to LAD, radial artery to obtuse marginal branch, and saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery).
Post-surgery, the patient remained symptom-free and active under cardiologist care.
9 Months Prior to Admission:

Knee replacement surgery for osteoarthritis.
Experienced alcohol withdrawal symptoms during hospitalization.
Night Before Admission:

Consumed 12 beers.
Experienced syncope (sudden collapse, facial trauma, brief unresponsiveness). Chest compressions were initiated by his wife; he regained consciousness within seconds.
Presentation to Emergency Services:

Found with a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure 65/40 mmHg, and normal blood glucose (98 mg/dL).
Electrocardiogram showed horizontal ST-segment depressions. Refused care initially but was brought to the hospital after stumbling.
Emergency Department Admission:

No chest pain or prodromal symptoms noted. Physical examination revealed facial abrasions but no major abnormalities except mild hearing loss and intermittent numbness in lower legs.
Hospitalization and Initial Tests:

Laboratory tests revealed ethanol level of 2347 mg/L, mild hyponatremia (sodium 129 mmol/L), and mild hypokalemia (potassium 3.1 mmol/L).
Imaging studies (chest radiograph, CT head) excluded acute abnormalities like hemorrhage or infarction.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed two extracardiac masses near the right atrioventricular groove causing tricuspid valve compression.
Diagnostic Investigations:

Cardiac MRI confirmed aneurysmal dilatations of the saphenous vein graft with thrombus and compression of the right atrium and ventricle.
Coronary angiography showed a patent graft to the posterior descending artery with poor distal flow.
Intervention:

Surgical resection of two aneurysmal segments of the saphenous vein graft with graft replacement using a new saphenous vein.
Temporal Relationships:
The syncope event was likely precipitated by alcohol-induced dehydration, diuretic use (furosemide), and mechanical compression of the heart from the saphenous vein graft aneurysm.
The patient's history of CABG with saphenous vein grafting set the stage for late-onset complications, culminating in the aneurysmal dilatation observed during this hospitalization.
Immediate interventions (imaging and eventual surgery) addressed the structural issues that caused the syncope.
