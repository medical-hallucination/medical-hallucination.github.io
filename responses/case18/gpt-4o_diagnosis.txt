Based on the provided case details, the possible diagnosis for the 63-year-old man is a saphenous-vein graft aneurysm. Key details supporting this diagnosis include:

1. **History of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):** The patient had a CABG that included a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery.

2. **Imaging Findings:** Preoperative and intraoperative images revealed aneurysmal segments compressing the tricuspid annulus and right atrium, indicating an enlarged vein graft.

3. **Histological Analysis:** Resected aneurysm showed atherosclerosis, organizing thrombus, macrophage infiltration, and scarring, all characteristic features of a saphenous vein graft aneurysm.

4. **Symptoms and Laboratory Findings:** The syncopal episode, serious electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia), alcohol intoxication, and transient hypotension could have contributed to syncope.

Overall, the combination of previous CABG, current imaging, histological findings, and cardiologic symptoms strongly indicates a saphenous-vein graft aneurysm.
