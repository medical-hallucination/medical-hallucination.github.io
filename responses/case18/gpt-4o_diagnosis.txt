Based on the clinical presentation, lab data, and imaging provided:

Possible Diagnosis:
Alcohol-Induced Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a long-term history of heavy alcohol consumption, with ethanol levels significantly elevated (>2000 mg/L). Chronic alcohol use can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and syncope.

Electrolyte Imbalance: The lab results indicate:

Hyponatremia (Sodium: 129 mmol/L)
Hypokalemia (Potassium: 3.1 mmol/L)
Hypomagnesemia (Magnesium: 1.5 mg/dL) These imbalances can cause cardiac arrhythmias, which might explain the syncope.
Ischemic Heart Disease (Chronic): The patient's history of multivessel coronary artery disease and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) raises suspicion of graft failure or ischemia as a contributing factor, especially given the elevated troponin (0.04 ng/mL) and creatine kinase levels.

Saphenous Vein Graft Aneurysm: Imaging findings (from echocardiograms and MRIs) describe aneurysmal changes in the grafts. This could compress adjacent cardiac structures, impair blood flow, and cause arrhythmias or syncope.

Ethanol-Related Acute Pancreatitis: Elevated lipase levels (128 U/L) could indicate mild acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol consumption.

Toxic Alcohol Levels: With ethanol at toxic levels, the patient's syncope could be due to alcohol-induced hypotension and bradyarrhythmia, compounded by electrolyte derangements.

Additional Considerations:
Postural Hypotension: Given his initial BP of 65/40 mmHg and history of stumbling, syncope could have been triggered by orthostatic hypotension.
Neurologic Event: Despite a normal neurological exam, transient hypoperfusion or an alcohol-induced seizure (even without jerking movements) should not be ruled out.
Suggested Next Steps:
Repeat imaging to evaluate graft patency and aneurysmal progression.
Correct electrolyte abnormalities (sodium, potassium, magnesium).
Monitor cardiac rhythm for arrhythmias.
Assess for alcohol withdrawal and provide supportive therapy.
Consider neurologic evaluation (e.g., EEG) to exclude seizure activity.
This multifactorial presentation requires integrated management focusing on cardiac, metabolic, and alcohol-related complications.
