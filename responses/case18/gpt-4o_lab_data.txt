Key Laboratory Findings and Analysis:
Sodium (129 mmol/L):

Reference Range: 135–145 mmol/L (Hyponatremia).
Clinical Significance: Low sodium levels may indicate dilutional effects or volume depletion. Chronic alcohol use and diuretic (furosemide) therapy could contribute to hyponatremia by affecting water balance and renal function. Hyponatremia can cause confusion, dizziness, or syncope, compounding the risk of falls.
Potassium (3.1 mmol/L):

Reference Range: 3.4–4.8 mmol/L (Mild Hypokalemia).
Clinical Significance: Hypokalemia can predispose to cardiac arrhythmias, especially in the context of existing coronary artery disease and structural heart abnormalities. It might have worsened the syncope event by contributing to reduced cardiac function or rhythm instability.
Ethanol Level (2347 mg/L):

Toxic Level: >1000 mg/L.
Clinical Significance: This extremely high ethanol level confirms acute alcohol intoxication, likely leading to vasodilation, dehydration, and orthostatic hypotension. These effects could precipitate syncope, especially with predisposing factors like tricuspid valve compression from the aneurysm.
Magnesium (1.5 mg/dL):

Reference Range: 1.7–2.4 mg/dL (Mild Hypomagnesemia).
Clinical Significance: Magnesium deficiency can exacerbate arrhythmias and is often linked with hypokalemia. It may also impair neuromuscular function, adding to the patient’s risk of collapse.
Troponin (0.04 ng/mL):

Reference Range: <0.03 ng/mL (Borderline Elevated).
Clinical Significance: Suggests minor myocardial injury, possibly due to transient ischemia or the hemodynamic effects of the aneurysm compressing cardiac structures. This finding underscores the importance of evaluating ischemic contributions to the syncopal event.
Creatine Kinase (CK) (887 U/L) and CK Isoenzymes (7.8 ng/mL):

Reference Range for CK: 60–400 U/L.
Clinical Significance: Elevated CK and isoenzymes indicate muscle injury. The facial trauma from the fall likely caused these elevations. Alternatively, alcohol myopathy could contribute to increased CK levels.
Lipase (128 U/L):

Reference Range: 13–60 U/L (Elevated).
Clinical Significance: May suggest acute or chronic pancreatitis, which can be associated with chronic heavy alcohol use. However, no clinical symptoms of pancreatitis were reported in this case.
Integration with Symptoms:
The laboratory abnormalities align with the patient's presentation:

Hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia could explain generalized weakness, orthostasis, and cardiac instability, all contributing to syncope.
Ethanol intoxication exacerbated dehydration, leading to reduced preload and contributing to orthostatic hypotension. The effect of alcohol likely combined with pre-existing heart compression from the saphenous vein graft aneurysm.
Elevated CK correlates with physical trauma sustained during the syncopal event.
Mild troponin elevation and aneurysm-induced structural heart issues suggest a cardiac component, such as transient ischemia or compression-induced low cardiac output, that played a role in the syncopal episode.
Conclusion:
The laboratory findings provide a comprehensive picture of systemic effects from chronic conditions (alcoholism, diuretic use, coronary artery disease) and acute exacerbations (dehydration, structural heart issues). These abnormalities culminated in syncope due to multifactorial contributors: hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalances, and aneurysmal cardiac compression.
