Below is a concise, chronological outline of the key events in this patient’s history and hospital course, together with the temporal relationships among symptoms, evaluations, and interventions:

1. Thirteen Years Prior to Admission  
   • Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.  
   • Diagnosis of multivessel coronary artery disease.  
   • Coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed (left internal mammary artery to LAD; radial artery to obtuse marginal branch; saphenous vein to posterior descending artery).  
   • Postoperatively remained active, symptom-free, and working full-time under regular cardiology follow-up.

2. The Night Before Admission  
   • Consumed 12 beers (heavy alcohol intake).

3. Event Leading to Hospital Presentation  
   • Patient stood up at night to use the bathroom.  
   • Collapsed with possible loss of consciousness; wife heard a “thud” and found him on the floor with facial trauma.  
   • Appearance was “gray,” prompting wife to begin chest compressions.  
   • No jerking movements or tongue laceration noted; possible urinary incontinence.  
   • Patient quickly regained consciousness “within seconds” of chest-compression initiation.  

4. Initial EMS Evaluation  
   • Patient was awake and alert but had no memory of the pre-hospital events.  
   • Denied any prodromal symptoms (no lightheadedness, palpitations, chest pain).  
   • Vital signs at that time: heart rate 50 beats/min, blood pressure 65/40 mm Hg, glucose 98 mg/dl.  
   • ECG: horizontal ST-segment depression of 1 mm in the inferior leads.  
   • Patient initially refused care; on attempting to stand, he stumbled.  

5. Transport to the Emergency Department  
   • Owing to his instability on standing, he was taken to the ED for further evaluation.

6. Hospital Evaluation  
   • Review of systems: no new chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or other concerning symptoms.  
   • Physical exam notable for mild facial abrasions, stable hemodynamics (heart rate 68 beats/min, BP 100/60 mm Hg), and no acute cardiopulmonary findings.  
   • Laboratory studies and repeat ECG performed:  
     – Mild electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).  
     – Elevated serum ethanol level.  
     – Slight troponin elevation that subsequently normalized.  
     – Peak creatine kinase level 9 hours after presentation.  
     – ECG: sinus rhythm, borderline first-degree AV block, a left atrial abnormality, and anterolateral J-point elevation (no new ST-segment changes).  

7. Initial Treatment and Admission  
   • Started on aspirin and intravenous heparin.  
   • Admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring and imaging studies.

Temporal Relationships Highlights:  
• The syncopal episode (with return of consciousness after brief chest compressions) followed immediately upon rising after heavy alcohol consumption.  
• The patient’s hypotension (BP 65/40 mm Hg) and bradycardia (HR 50 beats/min) were identified by EMS.  
• Despite initial refusal, he was brought to the ED after demonstrating unsteadiness on standing.  
• Once in the hospital, interventions included further cardiac workup and anticoagulation therapy (aspirin and IV heparin) begun shortly after ED evaluation.
