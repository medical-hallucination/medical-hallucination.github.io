A convenient way to think about this patient’s laboratory results is to group the abnormalities according to how they might contribute to his presentation with syncope and his overall clinical picture of chronic heavy alcohol use with known cardiac disease.

1. Electrolyte Abnormalities
* Hyponatremia (Na 129 mmol/L)
* Hypokalemia (K 3.1 mmol/L)
* Hypomagnesemia (Mg 1.5 mg/dL)
* Mild Hypocalcemia (Ca 8.4 mg/dL)

These derangements are classic in the setting of chronic heavy alcohol intake. Poor dietary intake, alcohol‐induced renal losses, and associated volume depletion can each contribute. From a clinical standpoint:
* Arrhythmogenic potential: Low potassium and low magnesium can predispose to various cardiac arrhythmias, which may cause syncope.
* Volume status/orthostasis: Hyponatremia and overall electrolyte imbalance can contribute to intravascular volume depletion, potentiating hypotension and dizziness or syncope on standing.

2. Liver and Pancreatic Enzyme Changes
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 60 U/L (mildly elevated)
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 38 U/L (upper-normal)
* Lipase 128 U/L (elevated)

An AST value higher than the ALT value (AST:ALT ratio > 1) is classically associated with chronic alcohol use. Although the elevations here are mild, they underscore ongoing hepatic stress, likely from chronic alcohol exposure. The elevated lipase raises the possibility of subclinical pancreatitis or at least pancreatic irritation, which is also common in heavy alcohol use.

3. Cardiac Injury Markers
* Troponin 0.04–0.03 ng/mL (reference <0.03)
* Creatine kinase (CK) 887 U/L (elevated)
* CK isoenzymes 7.8 ng/mL (ref 0–6.9)

These modest elevations may reflect either very mild myocardial injury (e.g., supply–demand mismatch, minor ischemia) or skeletal muscle injury (including from his fall). Importantly, his troponin remained only slightly above the cutoff, which makes a large infarction unlikely; however, in a patient with known coronary artery disease and prior CABG, even a small troponin elevation warrants close monitoring.

4. Ethanol Level
* Ethanol 2347 mg/L (noted as “>1000 mg/L, toxic”)

This extraordinarily high ethanol level on presentation highlights acute intoxication superimposed on chronic heavy use. Aside from its direct CNS depressant and vasodilatory effects (contributing to hypotension and syncope), alcohol also exacerbates the electrolyte derangements noted above.

5. Hematologic Indices
* Hemoglobin 13.4 g/dL, Hematocrit 36.7% (slightly below reference range)
* White‑cell count 6200/mm³ (normal)
* Platelet count 222,000/mm³ (normal)

The patient’s red‐cell indices suggest he is borderline anemic, which may be partly nutritional (common in alcoholism) or chronic‐disease related. However, there is nothing here acutely alarming, and the platelet count is adequate.

** Putting It All Together **

* Likely Cause of Syncope:
- Orthostatic or hemodynamic collapse from volume depletion and acute intoxication.
- Possible arrhythmia (e.g., bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia) exacerbated by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, both of which can destabilize cardiac conduction.

* Chronic Heavy Alcohol Use:
- Explains the classic electrolyte derangements (low K, Mg, Ca) and mild AST elevation higher than ALT.
- Could precipitate mild acute pancreatitis (elevated lipase).

* Cardiac Risk:
- Past CABG and stable but significant coronary artery disease.
- Mild troponin elevation suggests possible small areas of ischemia or mechanical/muscle injury.

In short, these lab findings tie closely to the patient’s history of long‐standing, heavy alcohol use (with its associated electrolyte disturbances and mild organ injuries), superimposed on known ischemic heart disease. Both the electrolyte disturbances and alcohol intoxication likely contributed to his syncopal episode, compounded by the possibility of an arrhythmia or simple low‐flow state.
