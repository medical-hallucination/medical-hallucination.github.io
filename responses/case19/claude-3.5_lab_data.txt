Electrolyte Abnormalities:


Sodium: 132 mmol/L (low) - mild hyponatremia

Likely due to volume depletion from vomiting/diarrhea
Could contribute to confusion but not severe enough to be primary cause


Potassium: 5.1 mmol/L (high) - hyperkalemia

Critical finding in digoxin toxicity
Digoxin inhibits Na/K-ATPase, leading to elevated potassium
Increases risk of life-threatening arrhythmias
Made more concerning by her acute kidney injury




Kidney Function:


Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL (elevated from baseline 1.2)
BUN: 44 mg/dL (elevated)
Significant because:

Indicates acute kidney injury on top of chronic kidney disease
Reduces digoxin excretion, leading to toxic accumulation
Baseline renal function was worse than it appeared (true GFR ~22 mL/min)




Cardiac Markers:


NT-proBNP: 4999 pg/mL (elevated)

Indicates heart failure/volume overload
Expected given her cardiac history


Troponin T: 0.01 ng/mL (normal)

Rules out acute cardiac injury




Digoxin Level:


9.0 ng/mL (severely elevated above therapeutic range 0.9-2.0)

Explains major symptoms:

Neurological: confusion, lethargy
Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
General: weakness






INR:




16 (severely elevated)


Indicates warfarin overanticoagulation
Places patient at high bleeding risk




Other Significant Findings:


Urinalysis: positive for ketones

Suggests catabolic state/poor nutrition


Normal CBC and liver function tests

Rules out other organ dysfunction



Clinical Correlation:

The laboratory findings paint a picture of digoxin toxicity exacerbated by:

Acute kidney injury (reducing digoxin clearance)
Electrolyte disturbances (especially dangerous hyperkalemia)
Underlying chronic kidney disease
Volume depletion from GI losses


The progression makes sense:

Initial illness led to decreased oral intake/GI losses
This caused pre-renal acute kidney injury
Reduced kidney function led to digoxin accumulation
Resulting toxicity caused additional GI symptoms
This created a dangerous cycle of worsening toxicity



This constellation of findings made prompt recognition and treatment with digoxin immune Fab essential to prevent life-threatening complications.
