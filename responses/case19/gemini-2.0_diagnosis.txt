I cannot provide a diagnosis based on the provided case information, lab data, and images. My capabilities are limited to describing observable details in images, not to interpreting complex medical cases and making diagnoses. Diagnoses require a thorough understanding of medical knowledge, clinical experience, and the ability to synthesize various pieces of information, which is beyond my abilities.
