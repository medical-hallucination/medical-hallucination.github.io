Timeline of Events
One week before admission:

The patient experienced symptoms suggestive of an upper respiratory infection (rhinorrhea, sore throat, and nonproductive cough). She felt feverish but did not measure her temperature.
Two days before admission:

She developed gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
One day before admission:

Neurological symptoms emerged: she asked repetitive questions and failed to recognize family members, indicating confusion and memory impairment.
Day of admission:

The patient reported global weakness and was brought to the emergency department due to her worsening condition.
Initial hospital assessment:

Examination revealed an irregular heart rhythm, cachexia, lethargy, and nonsensical responses. Chest X-rays and head CT were performed, showing cardiomegaly and nonspecific findings, respectively. Initial lab tests indicated acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, and elevated potassium.
Diagnostic focus:

Delirium was identified as the acute issue, prompting investigations into potential causes, including drug toxicity. The patient’s medications, such as digoxin and spironolactone, were flagged as potential contributors due to her renal impairment.
Intervention:

Digoxin toxicity was confirmed with a blood digoxin level of 9.0 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.9–2.0 ng/mL). She was treated with digoxin-binding antibody fragments (digoxin immune Fab).
Post-treatment and recovery:

Her mental status improved after treatment. Warfarin and digoxin were discontinued, and apixaban was prescribed for stroke prevention. Adjustments to her diuretics were made.
Follow-up:

Over the next 12 months, she had multiple outpatient visits and avoided further hospitalizations.
Temporal Relationships
Symptoms and cause: The initial respiratory symptoms may have been a trigger for subsequent volume depletion and renal impairment, exacerbating digoxin toxicity.

Neurological decline: Her confusion and memory issues temporally followed the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, likely linked to electrolyte imbalances and drug toxicity.

Intervention effectiveness: The administration of digoxin immune Fab addressed the toxicity, resulting in rapid improvement of her cognitive and physical status.
