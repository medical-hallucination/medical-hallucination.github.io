Here is a chronological order of key events with identified temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

### Timeline of Key Events

1. **One Week Before Admission**  
   - Symptoms: Rhinorrhea, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. The patient felt feverish but did not measure her temperature.  
   - **Observation**: No known illness in family or contacts.

2. **Two Days Before Admission**  
   - Symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea began.

3. **One Day Before Admission**  
   - Symptoms: The patient exhibited confusion, asking repetitive questions, and failing to recognize family members.

4. **Day of Admission**  
   - Symptoms: The patient reported global weakness and was brought to the emergency department by her daughter.  

   - **Emergency Department Findings**:  
     - No headache, changes in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain.  
     - Vital signs: Normal oxygen saturation, elevated blood pressure, and irregular pulse.  
     - Cachectic appearance, lethargy, nonsensical responses, intermittent compliance with commands, and dry mucous membranes.  
     - Cardiac findings: Irregular rhythm, loud S2, systolic murmur.  
     - Lung findings: Crackles in lower fields.  
     - Laboratory Findings: Electrolyte imbalance (low sodium, high potassium, low chloride), elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, and NT-proBNP levels. Normal troponin T.  
     - Imaging:  
       - Chest radiograph: Cardiomegaly, evidence of past surgeries, and mild pulmonary edema.  
       - CT head: Prominent ventricles and sulci, nonspecific white-matter hypodensities, no acute pathology.

5. **Hospital Admission**  
   - **Initial Management**: Diagnostic test performed (not specified in the text provided).

### Temporal Relationships
- **Initial Symptoms and Progression**:  
  Rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough one week before admission progressed to gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) two days before admission, followed by confusion and weakness.  

- **Intervention Timeline**:  
  The patient sought care after significant systemic symptoms (global weakness, confusion) and was admitted with laboratory and imaging findings suggestive of multiorgan impact.
