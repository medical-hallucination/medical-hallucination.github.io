Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Initial Period (7 months before current admission):

Initial routine prenatal visit with normal gestational sac and embryo
Uneventful prenatal follow-up
Abnormal 1-hour glucose tolerance test at 27 weeks gestation

One Week Before Current Admission (32 weeks gestation):

Development of severe symptoms:

3 days of severe (10/10) nonradiating pain starting in epigastric region, migrating to right upper quadrant and lower back
Severe nausea and inability to eat/drink without vomiting
Night sweats and difficulty sleeping due to back pain


Admitted to first hospital 4 days after pain began
Initial imaging revealed liver abnormalities
Transferred to second hospital the next day

Second Hospital Stay:

Additional imaging and liver biopsy performed
Biopsy revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma
Patient left against medical advice after one week

Current Admission (33 weeks gestation):

Transferred to current hospital
Colonoscopy revealed 5cm fungating mass in sigmoid colon
Condition deteriorated over 10 days with:

Increasing weakness
Need for higher narcotic doses
Worsening edema
Declining liver function



35 weeks gestation:

Cesarean delivery performed
Baby delivered successfully
Patient's condition rapidly deteriorated over 72 hours post-delivery
Patient declined chemotherapy
Saw baby only once
Died 5 days after delivery under hospice care

The progression shows a relatively healthy pregnancy until 32 weeks, followed by a rapid 3-week decline from initial severe symptoms to death, despite medical interventions.
