Let me organize the key events chronologically:

7 months before admission (approximately 6 weeks gestation):
- Initial routine prenatal visit
- Transvaginal ultrasound showed normal gestational sac and embryo

27 weeks gestation:
- Abnormal 1-hour glucose tolerance test

32 weeks gestation (1 week before current evaluation):
- Onset of severe symptoms:
  - Severe pain (rated 10/10) starting in epigastric region
  - Pain migration to right upper quadrant and lower back
  - Severe nausea
  - Inability to eat or drink without vomiting
  - Night sweats
  - Difficulty sleeping due to back pain
- These symptoms persisted for 3 days

32 weeks + 4 days gestation:
- First hospital admission to obstetrics service at another hospital
- Findings included:
  - Normal vital signs except slight tachycardia (96 bpm)
  - Right upper quadrant tenderness
  - Normal amylase, lipase, and white cell differential
  - Normal fetal heart tones and measurements
  - Normal fetal biophysical profile
  - Incidental finding of diffusely heterogeneous and nodular liver on renal ultrasound

33 weeks gestation (current evaluation):
- Evaluation at present hospital
- Diagnosis of adenocarcinoma made

The temporal progression suggests an acute onset of severe symptoms at 32 weeks that led to the discovery of underlying cancer through incidental imaging findings, with the formal cancer diagnosis being made one week later at the current hospital.
