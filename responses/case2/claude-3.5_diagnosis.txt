Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory data, and imaging findings, this appears to be a case of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed during pregnancy. Let me break down the key findings that support this diagnosis:

Clinical Presentation:


36-year-old pregnant woman at 33 weeks gestation
Severe epigastric/right upper quadrant pain
Night sweats
Nausea and vomiting
Back pain


Laboratory Findings (Table 1):


Elevated liver enzymes

AST (103 U/L) and ALT (66 U/L) are increased
Markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (229 U/L)
Elevated LDH (943 U/L)


Tumor markers are significantly elevated:

CEA: 60.2 ng/mL (normal 0-5.3)
CA 19-9: 68 U/mL (normal 0-55)
Alpha-fetoprotein: 560.4 ng/mL (normal 0-8.3)




Imaging Findings:


MRI (Figure 1A): Multiple hyperintense lesions in both liver lobes
CT (Figure 1B): Enlarged periaortic lymph nodes
CT (Figure 1C): Thickening of sigmoid colon with lymphadenopathy


Pathology:


Liver biopsy (Figure 2A/B): Shows metastatic adenocarcinoma with:

Malignant gland-forming proliferation
Fibrosis and necrosis
Features consistent with moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma


Colon biopsy (Figure 2C/D/E): Shows poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
Placental examination (Figure 3): Shows metastatic disease with CK20-positive cells

Final Diagnosis: Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with:

Primary in sigmoid colon
Metastases to liver
Lymph node involvement
Placental metastases
Diagnosed during third trimester of pregnancy

This represents a rare and challenging case of colorectal cancer diagnosed during pregnancy with extensive metastatic disease, including the unusual finding of placental involvement.
