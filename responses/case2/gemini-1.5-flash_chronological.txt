Chronological order of key events:

Patient has routine prenatal visit at 7 months pregnant - uneventful
Patient has abnormal glucose tolerance test at 27 weeks pregnant
One week before current evaluation (32 weeks pregnant), patient experiences severe abdominal pain for 3 days
Patient is admitted to another hospital due to pain
Patient is transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital at 33 weeks pregnant
Renal and abdominal ultrasounds are performed - kidneys and bladder normal, liver diffusely heterogeneous and nodular
Fetal heart tones are noted on Doppler ultrasound and measurements are appropriate for gestational age
Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are performed - reveal fungating mass in sigmoid colon
Biopsy of the mass is performed
Patient delivers baby via cesarean section at 35 weeks pregnant
Patient dies 5 days later
Temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

Abnormal glucose tolerance test at 27 weeks - not directly related to later symptoms or interventions
Severe abdominal pain starts at 32 weeks and leads to hospitalization at another hospital
Patient is transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital at 33 weeks likely due to concerning results at previous hospital
Ultrasounds are performed at 33 weeks to investigate cause of pain
Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are likely performed at 33 weeks to determine origin of cancer after ultrasounds show abnormalities
Biopsy is likely performed at time of colonoscopy/esophagogastroduodenoscopy
Cesarean section is performed at 35 weeks due to fetal compromise and declining maternal health
Patient dies 5 days later likely due to complications from cancer progression
