Here's a chronological timeline of the key events and their temporal relationships:

**Initial Prenatal Care:**

* **7 months prior:** Routine prenatal visit with normal transvaginal ultrasound.
* **27 weeks:** Abnormal 1-hour glucose tolerance test.

**Onset of Symptoms:**

* **32 weeks:**
    * 3 days of severe, non-radiating lower back pain (10/10).
    * Pain migration to right upper quadrant and epigastric region.
    * Severe nausea and vomiting.
    * Night sweats and sleep disturbance.

**Hospital Admission:**

* **32 weeks + 4 days:** Admission to another hospital due to persistent symptoms.

**Current Evaluation:**

* **33 weeks:** Evaluation at the current hospital.
    * Physical exam findings: tenderness in the right upper quadrant, soft gravid uterus.
    * Laboratory tests: abnormal liver function tests (Table 1).
    * Ultrasound: normal fetal heart tones, appropriate fetal measurements, normal biophysical profile, incidentally noted heterogeneous and nodular liver.

**Temporal Relationships:**

* The patient's severe symptoms, including back pain, nausea, vomiting, and night sweats, developed abruptly and rapidly worsened over 3 days.
* The abnormal liver function tests were likely a result of the underlying liver pathology, which may have contributed to the patient's symptoms.
* The incidental finding of a heterogeneous and nodular liver on ultrasound raised concerns for a potential liver malignancy.
