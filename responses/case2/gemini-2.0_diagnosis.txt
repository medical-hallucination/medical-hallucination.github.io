Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis is **Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma**.

Here's a breakdown of why:

**Presentation of Case:**

*   **36-year-old pregnant woman** at 33 weeks gestation.
*   **Acute onset of severe pain**, initially epigastric, migrating to the right upper quadrant and lower back. This is concerning for a possible intra-abdominal pathology.
*   **Severe nausea and vomiting** along with inability to eat or drink.
*   **Night sweats and difficulty sleeping** due to back pain. These are systemic symptoms that should raise alarm of a serious condition.
*   **Normal fetal parameters** are less suggestive of a primary obstetric issue.
*   **Initial normal prenatal visits** with later detection of abnormal liver findings suggests a developing condition.

**Lab Data:**

*   **Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT):**  Indicates liver injury or dysfunction. Levels are increasing.
*   **Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase:** Points towards a possible liver or bone condition. Levels are increasing.
*   **Elevated Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Another indicator of cellular damage. Levels are increasing.
*   **Elevated Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA):** Is a tumor marker associated with cancers of the digestive tract, particularly colorectal cancer.  Markedly elevated at 60.2 ng/ml on the first testing and still abnormal at 35.5 ng/ml on the second testing, this is significant for a possible malignancy.
*   **Elevated CA 19-9:**  A tumor marker which can be elevated with GI and pancreatic cancers.
*   **Elevated Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP):**  A tumor marker, can be elevated in pregnancy but much more likely due to malignancy, given the history and other test results.
*   **Elevated CA-125:** A tumor marker which can be elevated in cancer and pregnancy but is more likely with ovarian cancer.

*   **Elevated Platelet Count:** Can indicate a cancerous condition.

**Imaging:**

*   **Renal Ultrasound:** Kidneys and bladder were normal, but the liver showed **diffuse heterogeneity and nodularity**, which suggests metastasis to the liver.
*   **Abdominal MRI:** Multiple hyperintense lesions in both lobes of the liver are consistent with liver metastases.
*   **Abdominal CT:** Shows enlarged periaortic lymph nodes, which is suggestive of lymph node metastases. It also shows thickening of the sigmoid colon with adjacent lymphadenopathy, indicating a primary tumor site in the colon.

**Pathology:**

*   **Liver biopsy:** Shows malignant gland-forming proliferation, which is indicative of adenocarcinoma. The histological description as "moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma" suggests spread.
*   **Colon biopsy:**  Shows colonic mucosa replaced by a malignant proliferation with areas suggestive of gland formation, which is consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
*   **Placental specimen:** Reveals foci of malignant cells, morphologically similar to adenocarcinoma of the colon and are strongly positive for CK20. This further supports the colon as a primary site as CK20 is usually positive for colonic carcinoma. The placental involvement is indicative of metastatic disease.

**Putting it all together:**

The combination of a pregnant woman with:

*   A history of a normal initial pregnancy,
*   Acute onset of symptoms
*   Abnormal liver function tests with rising enzymes.
*   Multiple liver lesions on imaging.
*   Enlarged lymph nodes.
*   Colon thickening with adjacent lymphadenopathy.
*   Elevated tumor markers like CEA, CA 19-9, AFP and CA-125
*   Histological findings consistent with adenocarcinoma in both liver and colon biopsies and placental involvement.

All these point towards **metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma** as the most likely diagnosis.  The primary tumor is likely in the sigmoid colon and has metastasized to the liver, periaortic lymph nodes, and placenta.

**Differential Diagnoses**

While metastatic colorectal cancer is most likely, a few other less probable possibilities could be considered:

*   Primary liver cancer: Rare in this age group and unlikely with the colon findings.
*   Other GI cancers: Pancreatic or gastric cancer are possible but less likely with the confirmed colon findings.
*   Metastatic tumors from other primary cancers: Could be considered but would not explain the colonic thickening.
*   Other causes of liver dysfunction: Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome can cause liver dysfunction, but the liver lesions and tumor markers are not consistent. The patient is 33 weeks and if pre-eclampsia/HELLP occurs then its usually diagnosed before this time.

**Final diagnosis**

Based on the provided data, the final diagnosis would be **Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma with likely primary in sigmoid colon**.
