Chronological Ordering of Key Events and Temporal Relationships:
Initial Routine Prenatal Visit:

Event: Transvaginal ultrasonography reveals a normal gestational sac and embryo.
Temporal Relation: Start of pregnancy; sets a baseline for uneventful prenatal follow-up.
27 Weeks of Gestation:

Event: Abnormal results on a 1-hour glucose tolerance test.
Temporal Relation: No direct link to subsequent severe symptoms but marks the first medical irregularity.
32 Weeks of Gestation:

Event: Severe nonradiating back pain rated 10/10, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, and inability to eat.
Temporal Relation: Onset of significant symptoms prompting hospitalization.
Admission to the First Hospital:

Event: Examination reveals severe pain, normal amylase/lipase, heterogeneous liver appearance on imaging. Initial management includes IV fluids and medications.
Temporal Relation: Symptoms escalate, leading to further diagnostic steps.
Transfer to Second Hospital:

Event: Advanced imaging shows liver lesions and lymphadenopathy. Biopsy indicates metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Temporal Relation: Confirms cancer metastasis, marking the critical diagnostic pivot.
Admission to Third Hospital at 33 Weeks Gestation:

Event: Continuation of severe pain, no vaginal bleeding or contractions. Patient's status prompts detailed history and multidisciplinary involvement.
Temporal Relation: Builds on prior findings; leads to oncologic focus.
35 Weeks of Gestation:

Event: Delivery via cesarean section due to fetal compromise and declining maternal health.
Temporal Relation: Marks a transition from maternal care to addressing neonatal and end-of-life maternal needs.
Post-Delivery:

Event: Rapid maternal health deterioration; palliative measures; patient dies five days later.
Temporal Relation: Final phase of maternal illness, characterized by systemic decline.
Identified Temporal Relationships:
Symptoms and Cancer Progression: Severe back pain, nausea, and liver lesions signal the advanced stage of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
Interventions and Outcomes:
Early interventions (IV fluids, pain management) provided transient relief.
Diagnostic efforts (biopsies, imaging) confirmed the disease but highlighted its aggressive nature.
Cesarean delivery prioritized neonatal survival amidst maternal decline.
Delay in Treatment: The patient's reluctance to deliver earlier or commence chemotherapy exacerbated the progression of systemic illness, culminating in end-stage deterioration.
