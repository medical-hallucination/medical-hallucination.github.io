Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory data, imaging studies, and pathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. 

Key points supporting this diagnosis:

1. **Imaging**: MRI and CT scans reveal multiple liver lesions and thickening of the sigmoid colon with lymphadenopathy, indicating potential metastasis from a primary colorectal cancer.

2. **Pathology**: Biopsy specimens show moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the liver and colon. The immunohistochemical staining of the placenta is positive for CK20, a marker often associated with colorectal cancer.

3. **Laboratory Data**: Elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 are common in colorectal cancer.

These findings are consistent with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, and the presentation during pregnancy suggests it could be advanced and more challenging to diagnose early.
