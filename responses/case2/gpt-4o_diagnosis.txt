Based on the presentation, laboratory data, and imaging, the possible diagnosis is metastatic adenocarcinoma, likely originating from the colon, as supported by:

Clinical Presentation:

Severe back pain radiating to the epigastric region and right upper quadrant.
Nausea, vomiting, night sweats, and inability to eat.
Nodular liver appearance on imaging, consistent with metastatic disease.
Laboratory Findings:

Elevated alkaline phosphatase (229 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (943 U/L), and CA-125 (361 U/ml), indicative of malignancy.
Hypoalbuminemia (2.7 g/dl), suggesting chronic disease.
Mild anemia (Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dl), which can occur in cancer.
Imaging Findings:

Liver nodules seen on MRI, likely metastatic lesions.
Enlarged periaortic lymph nodes and thickened sigmoid colon on CT, consistent with colonic malignancy and lymphatic spread.
Pathological Findings (Figures 2 and 3):

Liver and colon biopsy showing adenocarcinoma morphology.
Immunohistochemical positivity for CK20, consistent with colonic origin.
This case suggests poorly differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma of colonic origin, complicating pregnancy.
