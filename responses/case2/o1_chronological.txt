Below is a summary of the key clinical milestones in chronological order, with an emphasis on which symptoms arose first and how clinicians intervened subsequently:

1) Approximately 7 Months before This Admission (Early Pregnancy, ~6 Weeks Gestation)  
   • The patient’s first prenatal visit: Transvaginal ultrasound showed a normal early intrauterine pregnancy (normal gestational sac and embryo).  
   • No notable abnormalities were reported at this time.

2) Routine Prenatal Course until 27 Weeks of Gestation  
   • Prenatal follow-up was described as “uneventful.”  
   • At 27 weeks: Abnormal 1-hour glucose tolerance test result. (No specific intervention is detailed in the excerpt, but this finding typically leads to a confirmatory 3-hour test and/or dietary counseling.)

3) At 32 Weeks of Gestation (One Week Before the Evaluation Described)  
   • The patient experienced 3 days of severe, nonradiating lower back pain (rated 10/10), beginning in the epigastric region and migrating to the right upper quadrant, then to the lower back.  
   • Concurrent symptoms: severe nausea, persistent vomiting (unable to tolerate food/fluids), night sweats, and difficulty sleeping.  
   • This evolution of pain and systemic symptoms (sweating, vomiting) prompted medical evaluation.

4) Four Days after the Onset of Pain (Still at ~32 Weeks)  
   • The patient was admitted to another hospital’s obstetrics service for further workup.  
   • On examination:  
     – Temperature 36.6°C; heart rate 96 bpm; blood pressure 105/68 mm Hg; O₂ saturation 97% on room air.  
     – Patient appeared uncomfortable; tenderness in the right upper quadrant; gravid uterus was soft.  
     – Laboratory tests: amylase and lipase levels normal; normal white-cell differential count; other labs shown in Table 1 (not detailed here).  
     – Fetal heart tones present, fetal measurements appropriate for gestational age, and fetal biophysical profile (BPP) normal.

5) Renal Ultrasound (During the Same Admission)  
   • Kidneys and bladder appeared normal.  
   • Incidental finding: the liver was “diffusely heterogeneous and nodular.”

6) Subsequent Evaluation at 33 Weeks of Gestation  
   • Shortly after these findings, the patient was evaluated at this hospital (Massachusetts General Hospital).  
   • The newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma was established in this timeframe.

Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions:  
• The severe epigastric → RUQ → back pain, along with associated nausea/vomiting, led to hospital admission and imaging studies.  
• Imaging (initially obtained to evaluate possible renal or biliary causes of pain) revealed an abnormal liver, which in turn prompted further investigation and ultimately the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

In summary, the key triggers for intervention were the abrupt onset of severe pain and GI symptoms at 32 weeks, leading to imaging that uncovered the suspicious nodular liver findings. This discovery then precipitated the diagnostic workup for adenocarcinoma.
