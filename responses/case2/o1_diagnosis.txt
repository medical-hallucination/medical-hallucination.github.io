Putting together all the clinical and pathologic clues in this case points to metastatic colon adenocarcinoma (likely originating in the sigmoid colon) that has widely spread (including extensive liver involvement, periaortic lymph nodes, and even the placenta). Key features supporting this diagnosis include:

1. Imaging Findings

* Liver: MRI (Panel A) showing multiple mildly hyperintense lesions in both lobes of the liver, and CT showing a diffusely nodular liver (consistent with metastatic deposits rather than a single primary hepatic lesion).
* Colon: CT (Panel C) demonstrating sigmoid-colon thickening and adjacent lymphadenopathy—suspicious for a primary colonic tumor.

2. Biopsy Results

* Liver Biopsy (Panels A and B) shows cores of liver replaced by a malignant, gland‐forming process surrounded by fibrosis and necrosis, consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.
* Colon Biopsy (Panels C, D, and E) reveals poorly differentiated gland‐forming malignant cells (adenocarcinoma).
* Placental Specimen (Figure 3) shows clusters of malignant cells positive for CK20 (a common marker in colorectal cancer), morphologically similar to the adenocarcinoma in the colon.

3. Laboratory Findings

* Pattern of liver‐enzyme abnormalities (marked elevation in lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase with relatively modest transaminase elevations) strongly suggests widespread tumor infiltration rather than a primary hepatic injury process.
* Elevated tumor markers (e.g., CA‑125, possibly others in the full laboratory panel) further indicate an advanced malignancy.

4. Clinical Presentation

* A 36-year-old pregnant woman presenting with severe right‐upper‐quadrant and back pain, along with weight loss, night sweats, and inability to tolerate oral intake—all of which raise concern for a systemic malignant process.
* The imaging and labs together point toward an advanced malignancy with extensive metastatic burden rather than an isolated liver or biliary issue.

Hence, the overall picture is most consistent with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of colonic origin, widely metastatic to the liver and other sites (including placental involvement).
