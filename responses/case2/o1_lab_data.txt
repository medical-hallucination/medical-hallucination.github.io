A helpful way to interpret this patient’s labs is to look at which values are most abnormal and then tie those abnormalities back to her presentation with severe abdominal and back pain, nausea/vomiting, and imaging that shows a nodular, heterogeneous‐appearing liver. Several points stand out:

1. Indicators of Liver Injury and Infiltration
* Markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (943 U/L; reference range ~135–225 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (229 U/L; reference range ~45–115 U/L) both suggest a process that is affecting the liver in a more “infiltrative” fashion (e.g., metastatic disease, widespread infiltration).
* Mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (103 U/L and 66 U/L, respectively) point to some degree of hepatocellular injury but are not as dramatically high as one might see with acute hepatitis.
* Normal total bilirubin with disproportionately elevated ALP and LDH is often seen with infiltrative hepatic processes rather than classic acute hepatocellular necrosis.
* Taken together, these enzyme patterns are consistent with metastatic or infiltrative lesions to the liver, fitting with the ultrasound description of a “heterogeneous and nodular” liver.

2. Anemia and Leukocytosis
* Hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL and hematocrit of 30.5% indicate a mild to moderate anemia, which could be from chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies, or blood loss. In the context of a new malignancy diagnosis, “anemia of chronic disease” is common.
* White‐cell count of 14,310 per mm³ reflects leukocytosis, which can occur with infection, inflammation, or as a stress response to malignancy or pain.

3. Nutritional Status and Protein Markers
* Albumin of 2.7 g/dL is low. In chronic illness or malignancy, albumin often decreases (reflecting poor nutritional status or decreased hepatic synthetic function).
* Mild hyponatremia (Na 131 mmol/L) and low‐normal BUN may also be related to relative volume status or overall poor oral intake.

4. Tumor Markers
* Very high alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP, 529 ng/mL) is classically associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and certain germ‐cell tumors. However, metastatic lesions to the liver from other primaries can sometimes also produce AFP.
* Elevated CA‐125 (361 U/mL) is often seen in ovarian cancer, but it can also be elevated in other malignancies, peritoneal irritation, and advanced liver disease.
* The extremely high AFP and nodular liver findings raise the possibility of either a primary hepatic malignancy (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) or a metastatic tumor that is capable of secreting AFP (e.g., certain gastrointestinal or germ‐cell tumors). Elevated CA‐125 further suggests peritoneal or ovarian involvement—but it can be nonspecific in the setting of widespread malignancy.

** Putting It All Together Clinically **
* The pattern of liver‐enzyme abnormalities (very high LDH and ALP, mildly elevated AST/ALT, relatively normal bilirubin) aligns with hepatic infiltration by tumor rather than a straightforward acute hepatitis picture.
* The very high AFP points toward hepatocellular carcinoma or an AFP‐producing metastatic tumor, which correlates with the finding of a “nodular” liver on ultrasound.
* The patient’s severe right‐upper‐quadrant and back pain could well be from capsular stretching of a heavily tumor‐infiltrated liver, while nausea, vomiting, and weight loss may reflect advanced malignancy.
* Night sweats and leukocytosis fit with a systemic inflammatory or neoplastic process.

Thus, from the laboratory standpoint, the key abnormal findings (marked LDH, ALP, and AFP elevations plus modest transaminase elevation) strongly suggest that her new diagnosis of “adenocarcinoma” involves the liver in an extensive or infiltrative way, explaining her severe pain and systemic symptoms.
