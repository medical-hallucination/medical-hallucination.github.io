Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Past Medical History (Prior to Current Illness):

25 years ago: Diagnosed with pulmonary TB in China, completed 14-month treatment
23 years ago: Immigrated to US, negative TB sputum test
12 years ago: Tested positive for HBV surface antigen, negative HBV DNA test
3 years ago: Evaluated for chronic cough, CT showed calcified granuloma and bronchiectasis

Current Illness Timeline:

Day 1-14 before admission:


Initial symptoms: Anorexia, fatigue, back/calf pain and tightness develop
Seen by PCP 6 days after symptom onset
Temperature 37.0°C, tender paraspinal muscles
Later that day: Fever spikes to 38.9°C with chills, sweats, rigors


~9 days before admission:


Visited traditional Chinese doctor for moxibustion treatment
Left testicular pain and swelling develop
Returns to PCP
Temperature 37.8°C
Started on levofloxacin


Hospital Admission and Treatment:


Admitted with persistent symptoms despite levofloxacin
Started on ceftriaxone
Temporal artery and testicular biopsies performed
Diagnosed with polyarteritis nodosa
Started on prednisone, fever resolves
Given rituximab, ivermectin, and entecavir before discharge


Post-Discharge Course:


2 weeks post-discharge: Received second rituximab dose, prednisone reduced
1 month later: Developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
Discontinued rituximab due to possible association with PRES
Continued prednisone for approximately 1 year
At 1 year: CD20+ B lymphocytes remained depleted
No recurrence of polyarteritis nodosa noted

This timeline shows a progressive illness that initially appeared to be an infection but failed to respond to antibiotics, leading to further workup and eventual diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa. The patient improved with immunosuppressive therapy but experienced a significant complication (PRES) that led to modification of the treatment plan.
