I'll help you chronologically order the key events in this patient's medical journey:

25 years ago:
- Diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in China
- Completed 14-month four-drug tuberculosis treatment
- Developed chronic cough with white sputum

Post-tuberculosis treatment:
- Immigrated to United States
- Induced sputum sample tested negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis

12 years before current admission:
- Tested positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen
- Began annual cancer surveillance with abdominal ultrasonography

3 years before current admission:
- Evaluated for chronic cough
- Chest radiography revealed right lung apex nodular opacity
- CT confirmed calcified granuloma and bronchiectasis
- Annual CT surveillance planned

14 days before current admission:
- Developed anorexia and fatigue
- Experienced back and calf pain and tightness

8 days before admission:
- Visited primary care physician
- Normal neurologic exam
- Lumbar spine radiography showed degenerative disk disease
- Prescribed ibuprofen

6-7 days before admission:
- Temperature reached 38.9째C
- Persistent fever, chills, sweats, rigors
- Severe myalgias impacting mobility
- Visited traditional Chinese doctor for moxibustion
- Left testicular pain and swelling developed

5 days before admission:
- Returned to primary care physician
- Screening tests for Lyme disease and other pathogens negative
- Prescribed 7-day course of levofloxacin

3 days before admission:
- Fever recurred (up to 39.0째C)
- Persistent symptoms: chills, rigors, anorexia, myalgias, arthralgias
- Intermittent abdominal pain
- Two episodes of non-bloody diarrhea
- 1 kg weight loss

2 days before admission:
- Developed blurry vision in left eye

Day of admission:
- Referred to emergency department
- Persistent symptoms
- Admitted to hospital

Hospital course:
- Day 1-6: Continued fever (38.1-39.6째C)
- Day 5: Chest CT showed enlarged bilateral pleural effusions
- Day 7: Left scrotal swelling/pain recurs
- Temperature peaked at 40.1째C

This chronology reveals a progressive and complex clinical course with multiple symptoms emerging and evolving over several weeks, characterized by persistent fever, systemic symptoms, and intermittent localized manifestations.

Key temporal relationships include:
1. Chronic tuberculosis history potentially related to current symptoms
2. Gradual onset of systemic symptoms over 2-3 weeks
3. Limited response to initial treatments (ibuprofen, levofloxacin)
4. Recurring and escalating fever pattern
5. Intermittent localized symptoms (testicular pain, abdominal pain)

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this timeline?
