Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis appears to be Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN). Here's the reasoning:
Key findings supporting this diagnosis:

Clinical Features:


64-year-old male with fever, chills, arthralgias
Testicular pain and swelling
Abdominal pain
Myalgias
Weight loss
Visual symptoms
History of HBV infection (known association with PAN)


Laboratory Findings:


Elevated inflammatory markers (leukocytosis)
Microscopic hematuria
Normal urine cultures
Negative infectious workup
Normal tumor markers


Imaging Findings:


Ultrasound showing heterogeneous testicular echotexture with increased vascularity
CT showing nonspecific inflammatory changes
Bilateral pleural effusions
No evidence of infection or malignancy on extensive workup


Most significantly, the histopathological findings (Figure 2) show:


Dense infiltrate of mononuclear cells in the adventitia
Fragmentation of elastic fibers
CD3+ lymphocytes and CD163+ histiocytes
These findings are classic for medium-vessel vasculitis like PAN


Additional supportive evidence (Figure 3):


Epididymal biopsy showing inflammatory cell aggregates
Testicular biopsy showing active spermatogenesis with transmural inflammation
Evidence of fibrinoid necrosis of small-caliber arteries

The combination of:

Multi-system involvement
Association with HBV
Characteristic histopathological findings of medium-vessel vasculitis
Absence of other explaining conditions
Negative workup for infection and malignancy

Makes Polyarteritis Nodosa the most likely diagnosis in this case.
The presence of HBV infection in this patient's history is particularly relevant, as HBV-associated PAN is a well-documented entity, though less common since the advent of HBV vaccination.
Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this diagnosis or discuss the differential diagnoses that were considered?
