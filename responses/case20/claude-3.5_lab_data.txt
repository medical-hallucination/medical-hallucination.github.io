I'll analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

Inflammatory Markers


Elevated CRP (144.8 mg/L; normal <8.0)
Elevated ESR (93 mm/hr; normal 0-13)
Elevated fibrinogen (725 mg/dL; normal 150-400)
These indicate significant systemic inflammation, consistent with vasculitis.


Complete Blood Count Changes


Leukocytosis (18,700/mmÂ³; normal 4500-11,000)
High neutrophils (76.6%)
Low lymphocytes (8.2%)
Fluctuating eosinophilia (9.6% initially, later 2.6%)
Mild anemia (Hgb 12.3 g/dL)
This pattern suggests acute inflammation/infection and possible immune dysregulation.


Liver Function Tests


Mildly elevated ALT (57 U/L; normal 10-55)
Elevated AST (73 U/L; normal 10-40)
Low albumin (2.7 g/dl; normal 3.3-5.0)
Suggests mild hepatic inflammation and poor nutritional status/chronic disease.


Coagulation Studies


Elevated PT (17.0 sec; normal 11.5-14.5)
Elevated INR (1.4; normal 0.9-1.1)
Indicates coagulation abnormalities, possibly related to inflammation.


Viral Studies


HBV core antibody positive but:

Negative HBV surface antigen
Negative HBV DNA
Negative HBV surface antibody
Shows past HBV infection without current active disease.




Urinalysis


2+ blood
10-20 RBCs/HPF
No active sediment
Suggests possible renal vasculitis.


Immunologic Studies


Positive ANA (1:40 and 1:160, speckled pattern)
Negative ANCA
Normal complement levels
Elevated free light chains
Pattern is consistent with systemic inflammation but not specific for any particular autoimmune disease.


Special Studies


Positive B. henselae IgG (1:128)
Positive strongyloides antibodies
These findings influenced treatment decisions regarding prophylaxis.

Clinical Correlation:

The elevated inflammatory markers, leukocytosis, and anemia correlate with the patient's systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue).
The urinary findings and liver function abnormalities reflect multi-organ involvement characteristic of polyarteritis nodosa.
The coagulation abnormalities and inflammatory markers support vascular inflammation.
The serologic studies helped exclude other diagnoses:


Negative ANCA ruled out ANCA-associated vasculitis
Past HBV infection without active disease influenced treatment decisions
Positive strongyloides antibodies led to prophylactic treatment before immunosuppression


The temporal progression of lab abnormalities matched the clinical course:


Initial presentation suggested infection
Persistence despite antibiotics
Pattern of multi-system involvement
Response to immunosuppression

This comprehensive laboratory evaluation was crucial in:

Establishing the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa
Excluding other conditions
Guiding treatment decisions
Monitoring disease activity
Identifying potential complications requiring prophylaxis
