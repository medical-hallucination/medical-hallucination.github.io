Here's a chronological ordering of the key events and identification of temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions in the case study:

25 years prior:

Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in China
14-month course of four-drug regimen
Persistent chronic cough
23 years prior:

Immigration to the United States
Negative sputum culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
13 years prior:

Diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
Negative HBV DNA test
3 years prior:

Evaluation for chronic cough
Chest X-ray: Nodular opacity at the right lung apex
CT scan: Calcified granuloma at the right apex, bronchiectasis
Annual surveillance with CT planned
14 days prior to current admission:

Anorexia, fatigue, back and calf pain
Primary care physician visit: Ibuprofen prescribed
6 days prior to current admission:

Fever, chills, sweats, rigors, severe myalgias
Moxibustion and cathartic agent administered
Left testicular pain and swelling
5 days prior to current admission:

Return to primary care physician
Negative Lyme disease, Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma tests
Levofloxacin prescribed
4 days prior to current admission:

Recurring fever, chills, rigors, anorexia, myalgias, arthralgias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, blurry vision
Ophthalmologic evaluation: Mild cataracts and dry eyes
3 days prior to current admission:

Chest X-ray: Persistent opacities at lung bases and right apex
CT scan of abdomen and pelvis: Mildly increased gallbladder wall enhancement, pericholecystic fluid, scattered hepatic cysts, bilateral pleural effusions, peritoneal fluid
Gallbladder ultrasound: Thickened gallbladder wall, sludge
Hospital Day 1:

Admission to the hospital
Levofloxacin discontinued, acetaminophen and doxycycline administered
Thoracentesis: Pleural fluid consistent with transudative effusion, negative for adenosine deaminase, Gram stain, acid-fast stain, and fungal cultures
Hospital Day 5:

CT scan of chest: Bilateral pleural effusions larger than on admission
MRI of spine: No diskitis, osteomyelitis, or epidural abscesses
MRI of liver: Scattered simple hepatic cysts
Hospital Day 7:

Recurring left testicular swelling, pain, and tenderness
Fever
Urinalysis: Microscopic hematuria
Testicular ultrasound: Engorgement of testicular vessels, heterogeneous testicular echotexture (suggestive of epididymo-orchitis)
Temporal Relationships:

Symptoms and Interventions:
Fever, chills, rigors, myalgias, arthralgias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss were followed by levofloxacin prescription and subsequent discontinuation.
Testicular pain and swelling led to testicular ultrasound and identification of epididymo-orchitis.
Respiratory symptoms and imaging findings prompted chest X-rays and CT scans.
Abdominal symptoms and imaging findings led to gallbladder ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
By understanding the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions, clinicians can better appreciate the progression of the patient's illness and the rationale for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.
