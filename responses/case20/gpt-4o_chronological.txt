Chronological Key Events:
25 Years Ago:

Patient diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in China.
Completed a 14-month course of treatment.
12 Years Ago:

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection diagnosed; nucleic acid amplification test for HBV DNA was negative.
Annual surveillance for cancer began.
3 Years Ago:

Chronic cough evaluated; chest CT showed a calcified granuloma and bronchiectasis.
Annual surveillance with CT initiated.
14 Days Before Current Admission:

Developed fatigue, anorexia, pain in the back and calves.
8 Days Before Admission:

Seen by the primary care physician (PCP); lumbar tenderness noted. Ibuprofen prescribed.
Fever (38.9°C), chills, sweats, rigors, and severe myalgias developed later that day.
5 Days Before Admission:

Left testicular pain and swelling appeared.
PCP prescribed levofloxacin for suspected infection.
On Admission:

Fever persisted despite levofloxacin.
Blood tests revealed leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers, and transaminases.
Chest X-ray and scrotal ultrasound performed; epididymo-orchitis suspected.
Admitted to the hospital, levofloxacin discontinued, doxycycline administered.
Hospital Course:

Persistent fever (up to 39.6°C) over six days.
MRI and thoracentesis ruled out other sources of infection.
Testicular ultrasound confirmed epididymo-orchitis.
Histologic examination of biopsy confirmed polyarteritis nodosa.
Temporal Relationships:
Symptom Onset and Interventions:
Early symptoms (fever, myalgias, testicular pain) were initially treated with NSAIDs and antibiotics without resolution.
Systemic symptoms (weight loss, recurrent fever) correlated with inflammatory marker elevations and led to further diagnostic testing.
Key Diagnostic Interventions:
Imaging (ultrasound, CT) and biopsy pinpointed testicular vasculitis as part of systemic polyarteritis nodosa.
Therapeutic Response:
Fever resolved with glucocorticoids and rituximab. Prednisone and prophylactic entecavir were continued to prevent HBV reactivation.
