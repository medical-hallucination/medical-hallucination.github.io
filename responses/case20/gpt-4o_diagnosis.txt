Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and biopsy findings, the possible diagnosis for this patient is polyarteritis nodosa (PAN).

### Key Points Supporting the Diagnosis:

1. **Clinical Presentation:**
   - The patient presented with fever, chills, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain.
   - There is a history of hepatitis B infection, which is associated with PAN.

2. **Laboratory Findings:**
   - Elevated acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate).
   - Negative tests for ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies), ruling out ANCA-associated vasculitis.
   - Negative blood cultures, ruling out infectious causes.

3. **Biopsy Findings:**
   - The epididymal and testicular biopsy shows transmural inflammation of small and medium-sized arteries with fibrinoid necrosis, typical for PAN.
   - Temporal artery biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration and disruption of elastic fibers aligns with vasculitis.

4. **Imaging:**
   - Imaging findings such as the nodular opacities and testicular involvement are consistent with systemic vasculitis.

Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium-sized muscular arteries, which can involve the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, peripheral nerves, skin, and testes, correlating with this patient's symptoms.
