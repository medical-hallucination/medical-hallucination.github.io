Based on the comprehensive patient case, lab data, imaging findings, and clinical history, the possible differential diagnoses for this patient could include:

1. Epididymo-orchitis
Evidence:
New left testicular swelling, pain, and tenderness.
Heterogeneous echotexture of both testes and vascular engorgement on ultrasonography.
Elevated white-cell count and persistent fever.
Hematuria (10-20 red blood cells per high-power field in urine).
Cause: Likely infectious, possibly linked to urogenital pathogens or secondary to systemic infection.
2. Systemic Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa)
Evidence:
Fever, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular involvement, which are classic features.
Chronic hepatitis B history, which can predispose to vasculitis.
Elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 144.8 mg/L, ESR 93 mm/hr, fibrinogen 725 mg/dL).
Signs of systemic involvement (pleural effusions, gallbladder wall thickening, microscopic hematuria).
Cause: Immune-mediated vessel inflammation triggered by HBV or other systemic triggers.
3. Infective Endocarditis
Evidence:
Persistent fever and leukocytosis.
Multiple systemic findings, including pleural effusions and abdominal pain.
Negative echocardiography findings argue against this, but embolic phenomena from subclinical infection should be considered.
4. Disseminated Tuberculosis
Evidence:
History of tuberculosis.
Chronic cough, apical calcified granuloma on imaging.
Systemic features of fever, weight loss, and elevated inflammatory markers.
Cause: Reactivation or extrapulmonary spread, though imaging findings and pleural fluid analysis are not definitive.
5. Brucellosis
Evidence:
Endemic exposure history (e.g., living in China).
Symptoms: fever, arthralgia, testicular pain, hepatobiliary abnormalities.
Compatible with epididymo-orchitis and systemic inflammatory response.
6. Testicular Malignancy
Evidence:
Testicular swelling, heterogeneous echotexture.
However, systemic symptoms and lab findings strongly suggest an inflammatory or infectious process over malignancy.
Diagnostic Next Steps:
Blood and urine cultures, targeting urogenital and systemic pathogens.
Autoimmune panel to evaluate vasculitis.
Specific serologies for Brucella, HBV-associated vasculitis, or tuberculosis.
Biopsy of the epididymis or testicle if epididymo-orchitis persists or worsens.
Imaging-guided aspiration or repeat ultrasonography if abscess formation is suspected.
Most Likely Diagnosis:
Given the systemic features, prior HBV history, and testicular involvement, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) should be strongly considered alongside infectious causes like epididymo-orchitis or brucellosis.
