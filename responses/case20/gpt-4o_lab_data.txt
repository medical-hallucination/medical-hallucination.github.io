Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Their Clinical Significance:
Hematological Findings:
Leukocytosis (WBC: 18,700/mm³):

Elevated white blood cell count indicates systemic inflammation or infection, consistent with the patient's fever and systemic symptoms (myalgias, testicular swelling).
Neutrophilia (76.6%) and Lymphopenia (8.2%):

Neutrophilia suggests an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process.
Lymphopenia is often seen in systemic inflammation or stress responses.
Mild Anemia (Hemoglobin: 12.3 g/dL):

Likely due to chronic inflammation ("anemia of chronic disease"), supported by elevated inflammatory markers.
Inflammatory Markers:
C-Reactive Protein (CRP: 144.8 mg/L) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR: 93 mm/hr):

Both are markedly elevated, reflecting significant systemic inflammation, aligning with the patient's fever, arthralgias, and myalgias.
Fibrinogen (725 mg/dL):

Elevated fibrinogen indicates an acute-phase reaction, commonly seen in vasculitis or other inflammatory states.
Renal Function and Electrolytes:
Slightly Elevated Creatinine (1.23 mg/dL):
May indicate mild renal involvement, which can occur in systemic vasculitis like polyarteritis nodosa (PAN).
Normal Sodium (136 mmol/L) and Potassium (3.5 mmol/L):
Electrolytes were stable, suggesting no acute kidney dysfunction at the time of testing.
Liver Function Tests:
Elevated Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST: 73 U/L) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT: 57 U/L):

Reflect mild hepatocellular injury, possibly linked to systemic inflammation or hepatic involvement in PAN.
Normal Bilirubin and Alkaline Phosphatase:

Absence of significant cholestatic liver injury.
Urinalysis:
Microscopic Hematuria (10–20 RBC/HPF):

Suggests renal or urinary tract involvement, consistent with vasculitis affecting medium-sized vessels.
No Leukocyturia or Proteinuria:

Indicates no active infection or severe glomerular injury.
Immunologic Findings:
Positive Antinuclear Antibody (ANA, speckled pattern at 1:40 and 1:160):
Non-specific finding but suggests autoimmune activity.
Negative ANCA, Rheumatoid Factor, and Cryoglobulin Tests:
Rules out ANCA-associated vasculitides and cryoglobulinemia, supporting the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa.
Infectious Disease Workup:
Negative Viral Markers (HBV DNA, HIV, Hepatitis C RNA):
Excludes active HBV or other viral infections as triggers of systemic inflammation.
Negative Blood Cultures and Serologies (Brucella, Bartonella, Q fever):
Rules out common bacterial or zoonotic infections.
Other Findings:
Elevated Free Kappa and Lambda Light Chains:
Suggests polyclonal B-cell activation, common in systemic inflammatory conditions.
Positive Strongyloides Antibody:
Indicates past or latent infection, which is significant in the context of planned immunosuppressive therapy.
Clinical Correlation:
Systemic Vasculitis:
The constellation of symptoms (fever, arthralgias, myalgias, testicular pain) and elevated inflammatory markers strongly suggests an active systemic inflammatory process.
Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN):
Findings like leukocytosis, elevated CRP/ESR, microscopic hematuria, and testicular involvement align with medium-vessel vasculitis.
Mild Organ Dysfunction:
The involvement of kidneys, liver, and possibly gallbladder points to multisystem disease typical of PAN.
