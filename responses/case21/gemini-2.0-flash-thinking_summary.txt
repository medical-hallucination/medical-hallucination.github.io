Post-Hospitalization Follow-Up

Items for Post-Hospitalization Follow-Up:
- Follow-up blood smear examination (completed and negative 2 weeks post-treatment).
- Monitoring of hemoglobin and platelet levels to ensure normalization (normalized at 10 weeks follow-up).
- General follow-up with primary care physician for ongoing health maintenance and monitoring of chronic conditions.
Pending Results: N/A (All results available during hospitalization)
Hospital Course Narrative

The patient presented with a 1-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Initial evaluation included ruling out cardiovascular and pulmonary causes of dyspnea. Physical exam was largely unremarkable except for pursed-lip breathing. Initial labs showed anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Troponin was mildly elevated. CT scans revealed liver abnormalities and splenomegaly, but no pulmonary embolism or masses. Echocardiogram showed mild structural heart changes. Myocardial perfusion scan was normal.  Further lab investigations revealed evidence of hemolytic anemia (elevated LDH, undetectable haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin, elevated ferritin, low transferrin saturation).  Initial blood smear was negative, but repeat smear on hospital day 4 revealed intraerythrocytic ring-form trophozoites. PCR for Babesia microti was positive, confirming the diagnosis of Babesiosis.  Treatment with azithromycin and atovaquone was initiated on hospital day 4 and continued for 10 days. Repeat blood smear 2 weeks post-treatment was negative. At 10 weeks follow-up, hemoglobin and platelet count had normalized, and dyspnea had resolved. The patient tolerated treatment well without reported complications during hospitalization.

Service-Specific Hospital Course

NEURO: Head CT was normal. Patient presented with new onset morning headaches, which resolved with analgesics and caffeine and did not recur during hospitalization after treatment initiation.
CV: Mildly elevated, stable troponin level was noted. Echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild diastolic dysfunction, moderate left atrial enlargement, mild right atrial enlargement, and mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, but no regional wall motion abnormalities. Myocardial perfusion scan showed no ischemia.  Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal.
PULM: Patient presented with exertional dyspnea. CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism. Pursed-lip breathing was noted on examination. Dyspnea resolved after treatment of Babesiosis.
GI: CT abdomen and pelvis showed liver abnormalities (irregular nodular contour, widening of fissures, caudate hypertrophy) consistent with possible cirrhosis and splenomegaly. Liver function tests showed mild elevation of transaminases and bilirubin.
HEME: Patient presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia.  Hemolytic anemia was diagnosed based on lab findings (elevated LDH, undetectable haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin, elevated ferritin, low transferrin saturation).  Anemia and thrombocytopenia resolved after treatment of Babesiosis.
ID: Infectious disease was consulted due to suspicion of hemolytic anemia and potential infectious etiology. Babesiosis was diagnosed and treated with azithromycin and atovaquone. Patient responded well to treatment with resolution of parasitemia and symptoms.
