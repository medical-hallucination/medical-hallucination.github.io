Physician Discharge Summary

Admission Details

Admit Date: N/A (The case states presentation in the "summer of 2021," but no specific date is given. We know he was hospitalized for at least 4 days, as diagnosis was made on day 4.)

Discharge Date: N/A (Not explicitly stated, but we can infer at least 10 days after admission, given the treatment duration. A reasonable estimate would be 10-14 days post-admission.)

Reason for Admission

Progressively worsening exertional dyspnea (1-month history)

Fatigue (1-month history)

New onset of headaches on awakening, worse in the supine position, relieved by aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine.

Principal Problem: Babesiosis with hemolytic anemia

Active Problems:

Anemia (normocytic, hemolytic)

Hepatic abnormalities (consistent with cirrhosis on imaging)

Splenomegaly

Elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, fibrinogen)

Resolved Problems:

Dyspnea (resolved after treatment)

Diagnosis at Discharge

Principal Diagnosis: Babesiosis with associated hemolytic anemia

Additional Diagnoses:

Procedural Information

Surgeries This Admission: N/A

Procedures This Admission:

Blood smear evaluation (revealed intraerythrocytic ring-form trophozoites)

PCR testing for B. microti (positive)

CT head (normal)

CT abdomen and pelvis (showed liver abnormalities consistent with cirrhosis and splenomegaly)

CT angiography of the chest (ruled out pulmonary embolism)

Transthoracic echocardiogram (showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and other mild abnormalities, but no heart failure)

Myocardial perfusion single-photon-emission CT scan (no regional perfusion deficits)

Serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi (negative)

PCR test for Anaplasma phagocytophilum and ehrlichia species (negative)

Post-Hospitalization Follow-Up

Items for Post-Hospitalization Follow-Up:

Repeat complete blood count (CBC) to confirm resolution of anemia and thrombocytopenia (achieved 10 weeks after treatment initiation in the case).

Monitor for any recurrence of symptoms.

Continued management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Counseling on alcohol cessation.

Consider hepatology consultation for further evaluation and management of cirrhosis.

Education on tick bite prevention.

Pending Results: N/A

Hospital Course Narrative

The patient, a 76-year-old male, presented with a 1-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and new-onset morning headaches. Initial evaluation ruled out acute cardiopulmonary causes, including myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Laboratory findings revealed normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL, decreasing to 9.0 g/dL on day 4), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 106,000/µL), elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and elevated inflammatory markers. Imaging revealed liver abnormalities consistent with cirrhosis and splenomegaly.

The key diagnostic finding was the identification of intraerythrocytic ring-form trophozoites on a thin blood smear, confirmed by a positive PCR test for Babesia microti. This established the diagnosis of Babesiosis. The patient did not recall a tick bite, but frequented areas with high tick exposure.

Treatment was initiated with azithromycin and atovaquone for a 10-day course. The patient's dyspnea resolved, and follow-up blood work 10 weeks later showed normalization of hemoglobin and platelet counts. The patient's hemolytic anemia was attributed to Babesiosis. The elevated inflammatory markers were also attributed to the infection.

No complications were encountered during the hospitalization.

Service-Specific Hospital Course

NEURO: CT of the head was normal. No focal neurological deficits.

CV: EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Echocardiogram showed mild structural changes but no heart failure. Myocardial perfusion scan was negative.

PULM: CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism. No infiltrates or masses. Pursed-lip breathing noted on exam, but no wheezes or rhonchi.

GI: CT abdomen/pelvis showed liver findings consistent with cirrhosis and splenomegaly. No signs of hepatic decompensation.

HEME: Normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, undetectable haptoglobin, negative direct and indirect antiglobulin tests – consistent with nonimmune hemolytic anemia.

ID: Diagnosis of Babesiosis confirmed. Treated with azithromycin and atovaquone. Negative testing for other tick-borne illnesses.

Medications & Discharge Planning

Prior to Admission Medications:

Amoxicillin (daily, for suppressive therapy)

Aspirin (daily)

Fexofenadine

Gabapentin

Losartan

Simvastatin

Tamsulosin

Multivitamin

Medication List (During Admission):

Azithromycin

Atovaquone

Continued home medications (likely, though not explicitly stated)

STOP Taking These Medications: N/A (Based on the provided information, no medications were explicitly stopped. It's possible amoxicillin was held during treatment for Babesiosis, but this is not stated.)

TAKE These Medications:

Azithromycin and Atovaquone were completed during the hospital stay.

Continue home medications (as above).

Discharge Orders:

Activity: As tolerated.

Diet: Regular diet, with emphasis on alcohol cessation.

Wound Care: N/A

Care Instructions:

Monitor for any recurrence of symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, fever, chills).

Practice tick bite prevention measures (protective clothing, insect repellent, regular skin checks).

Follow-Up Appointments:

Follow-up with primary care physician (timing not specified, but typically within 1-2 weeks).

Repeat CBC (occurred 10 weeks later in the case).

Consider hepatology consultation.

Discharge Exam:

Not explicitly detailed, but we can infer that the patient was stable, afebrile, and no longer experiencing dyspnea.

Lab Data (at time of discharge):

Not provided at exact time of discharge, but 10 weeks post treatment: Hemoglobin and platelet count normalized.
