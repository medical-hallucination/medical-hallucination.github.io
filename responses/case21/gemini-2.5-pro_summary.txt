Hospital Course Narrative

This 76-year-old male with a history of treated anal cancer, HTN, HLD, OSA, and heavy alcohol use presented with a 1-month history of progressive exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and new morning headaches. Initial vital signs were stable with normal oxygen saturation. Physical exam was notable for pursed-lip breathing but otherwise unremarkable cardiopulmonary findings and no signs of volume overload or acute neurological deficits.

Initial laboratory workup revealed normocytic anemia (Hgb 10.9 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (Plt 106,000/mcL), both noted to be new compared to 1 year prior. Mildly elevated LFTs, mildly elevated stable troponin T (25 ng/L), and significantly elevated D-dimer (1693 ng/mL) were also present. NT-proBNP was normal. Imaging (CT head, CTA chest) ruled out acute intracranial pathology and pulmonary embolism. CT abdomen/pelvis revealed findings consistent with liver cirrhosis and mild splenomegaly. Cardiac workup including ECG, echocardiogram, and SPECT scan showed chronic changes (LVH, LAE, diastolic dysfunction) but no evidence of acute ischemia, significant valvulopathy, or heart failure explaining the profound dyspnea.

Given the persistent symptoms and unexplained anemia/thrombocytopenia, further investigation into hemolysis was pursued. Labs revealed elevated LDH (574 IU/L), undetectable haptoglobin, and negative direct/indirect antiglobulin tests, consistent with nonimmune hemolytic anemia. ESR and CRP were markedly elevated. On hospital day 4, hemoglobin decreased further to 9.0 g/dL. A peripheral blood smear examination was performed, revealing intraerythrocytic ring-form trophozoites with 2.1% parasitemia. PCR testing subsequently confirmed Babesia microti infection. Tests for common co-infections (Lyme, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia) were negative.

The patient was diagnosed with Babesiosis causing nonimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, leading to his presenting symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and likely contributing to headaches and mild myocardial injury (demand ischemia). He was treated with a 10-day course of azithromycin and atovaquone. His clinical symptoms resolved. Follow-up testing showed clearance of parasitemia on blood smear at 2 weeks post-treatment initiation, and normalization of hemoglobin and platelet count by 10 weeks post-presentation.

Service-Specific Hospital Course

NEURO: Presented with headaches, worse supine. CT Head negative. Headaches resolved with Babesiosis treatment. No focal deficits.

CV: Ruled out acute atherothrombotic MI and heart failure as primary cause of dyspnea. Mild stable troponin elevation attributed to Type 2 MI from anemia/demand. Chronic hypertensive changes noted on echo.

PULM: Presented with dyspnea. CTA chest negative for PE. Dyspnea resolved with treatment of anemia secondary to Babesiosis. OSA managed with home CPAP.

GI: CT findings strongly suggestive of underlying liver cirrhosis, likely secondary to chronic heavy alcohol use. Mild splenomegaly noted. LFTs mildly elevated, improved with treatment. Needs outpatient evaluation/management of cirrhosis.

HEME: Diagnosed with nonimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia secondary to Babesiosis. Hgb nadir 9.0 g/dL. Platelets 106,000/mcL initially. Both normalized post-treatment.

ID: Diagnosed with Babesia microti infection via blood smear and PCR. Treated successfully with 10-day course of azithromycin and atovaquone. Testing for relevant co-infections negative. Tick exposure history elicited (likely environmental).
