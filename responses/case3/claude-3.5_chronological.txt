Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events from this case:
15 months before presentation:

Diagnosed with influenza
Subsequently developed persistent fatigue and excessive sleepiness

13 months before presentation:

First motor vehicle accident - fell asleep while driving
Car crossed into other lane and off road, but no collision or trauma

7 months before presentation:

Second motor vehicle accident - collided with turning vehicle
Developed intermittent neck and back muscle spasms
Delayed seeking medical care until next day due to fatigue

After second accident:

Underwent evaluation at primary care clinic
Scored 20 on Epworth Sleepiness Scale (indicating excessive daytime sleepiness)
Referred for formal sleep study
Prescribed naproxen and cyclobenzaprine
Completed physical therapy with improvement in muscle spasms

Day before presentation:

Sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, mild nonproductive cough
Symptoms were severe enough to prevent work attendance

Day of presentation:

Symptoms had spontaneously improved by morning
Evaluated at primary care clinic
Requested injectable naltrexone
Disclosed history of oxycodone use
Prescribed oral naltrexone but did not complete ordered toxicology screening

2 months after presentation:

Requested referral for psychotherapy due to increased stress

6 months after presentation:

Evaluated at psychology clinic
Disclosed extensive substance use history
Made plan for cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness

7 months after presentation:

Seen by primary care physician
Toxicology positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, cocaine
Initiated buprenorphine treatment
Connected with recovery coach

15 months after presentation:

Successfully maintaining treatment
In full sustained remission
Working full-time and parenting
Continuing engagement with medical team and recovery coach

This timeline reveals a progression from untreated opioid use disorder contributing to accidents and fatigue, through initial reluctance to fully engage in treatment, to eventual successful recovery with appropriate medical and support services.
