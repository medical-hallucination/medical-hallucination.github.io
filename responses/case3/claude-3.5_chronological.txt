Let me create a chronological timeline of key events and relationships:

17 years before presentation
- Started smoking cigarettes (1 pack/week)

~10 years before presentation (age 19)
- Became pregnant
- Abruptly stopped using illicit drugs after 5 years of use (had started in middle school)

8 years after daughter's birth
- Resumed regular oral opioid use after starting work at a bar
- Began escalating oxycodone use due to increased cravings/withdrawal

15 months before presentation
- Diagnosed with influenza
- Developed persistent fatigue and excessive sleepiness afterward

13 months before presentation
- First car accident: fell asleep while driving, crossed lanes and went off road
- No injuries or collisions

7 months before presentation
- Second car accident: collided with turning vehicle
- Developed neck and muscle spasms
- Delayed seeking care due to fatigue
- Received naproxen and cyclobenzaprine
- Completed physical therapy
- Had sleep study referral after Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 20

Day before presentation
- Sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, mild cough
- Too severe to attend work initially
- Symptoms improved spontaneously by clinic visit

At presentation
- Appeared well during examination
- Disclosed nonprescribed oxycodone use
- Requested injectable naltrexone
- Prescribed oral naltrexone but didn't complete screening or follow-up

2 months after presentation
- Requested psychotherapy referral due to increased stress

6 months after presentation
- Seen at psychology clinic
- Reported depressive symptoms and episodes of heightened energy
- Disclosed extensive substance use history
- Using 120mg oxycodone daily, spending $3000/month
- Plan made for cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness

7 months after presentation
- Saw primary care physician
- Oral-fluid toxicology positive for multiple substances

This timeline reveals several important patterns:
1. Long-term substance use punctuated by an 8-year period of sobriety
2. Post-influenza fatigue leading to two car accidents
3. Escalating opioid use concurrent with increasing life stressors
4. Multiple attempts to seek treatment, though often with incomplete follow-through
