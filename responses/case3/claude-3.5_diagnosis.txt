Based on the case presentation and the diagnostic criteria shown in Table 1, this patient clearly meets the criteria for Severe Opioid Use Disorder. Let me break down why:

Impaired Control (meets all 4 criteria):


Uses escalating amounts of oxycodone (120mg/day)
Made multiple unsuccessful attempts to stop using
Spends substantial time and money ($3000/month) obtaining/using opioids
Has strong cravings demonstrated by escalating use


Social Impairment (at least 1 criterion met):


Risk of losing custody of her daughter
Missing work due to withdrawal symptoms


Risky Use (meets both criteria):


Multiple motor vehicle accidents likely related to opioid use/withdrawal
Continues use despite worsening mood disorder and physical injuries


Pharmacologic Dependence (meets both criteria):


Tolerance (needs escalating amounts)
Withdrawal (misses work due to withdrawal symptoms, current presentation consistent with withdrawal)

The severity is classified as severe because the patient meets at least 6 criteria (she actually meets 9-10 criteria) from the DSM-5 diagnostic framework shown in the table.
Additional supporting evidence includes:

Long history of substance use starting in middle school
Failed attempts at treatment with naltrexone
Recent toxicology positive for multiple substances including oxycodone, buprenorphine, and cocaine
Clear functional impairment affecting work, family life, and personal safety

The initial presentation with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and muscle aches is also consistent with opioid withdrawal symptoms, suggesting physical dependence.
