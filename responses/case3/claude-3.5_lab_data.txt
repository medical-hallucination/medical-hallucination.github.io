Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:
Key Laboratory Results:

Oral-fluid toxicology screening was positive for:


Oxycodone
Buprenorphine
Benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite)
Cocaine (parent molecule)
Negative for fentanyl


Liver function tests were normal
Urinary human chorionic gonadotropin was negative (not pregnant)

Clinical Significance:

Oxycodone Positive:


Confirmed patient's reported oxycodone use disorder
Validated her self-reported use of 120mg daily
Indicated ongoing active opioid use disorder requiring intervention


Buprenorphine Positive:


Confirmed patient's history of using non-prescribed buprenorphine
Suggested attempts at self-treatment for opioid dependence
Indicated potential receptiveness to prescribed buprenorphine therapy


Cocaine and Benzoylecgonine:


Revealed concurrent stimulant use not initially disclosed
Indicated polysubstance use
Required addressing multiple substance use disorders in treatment plan


Negative Fentanyl:


Suggested patient was not using heroin (often contaminated with fentanyl)
Supported her report of using only prescription opioids


Normal Liver Function:


Indicated no organ damage from substance use
Suggested safety for medication-assisted treatment
Allowed for full dosing options of treatment medications


Negative Pregnancy Test:


Ruled out pregnancy as a factor in treatment planning
Allowed for broader medication options

Choice of Testing Method:

Oral fluid testing was particularly valuable because:

Less susceptible to tampering than urine testing
Detected both parent drugs and metabolites
Provided more accurate recent use information
Direct observation possible during collection



The laboratory findings were crucial for:

Confirming the diagnosis of opioid use disorder
Identifying polysubstance use requiring treatment
Guiding appropriate medication selection
Establishing baseline health status
Informing the overall treatment approach

This comprehensive testing profile helped develop an evidence-based treatment plan addressing both the opioid use disorder and concurrent cocaine use.
