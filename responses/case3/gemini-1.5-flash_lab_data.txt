Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance

Oral Fluid Toxicology Screening:

Oxycodone: This finding directly confirms the patient's history of opioid use and aligns with her reported consumption of 120 mg daily. It also explains her withdrawal symptoms and the need for treatment.
Buprenorphine: Detection of buprenorphine indicates the patient's self-treatment attempts with this medication to manage withdrawal and cravings. This suggests a degree of self-awareness and potential motivation for treatment.
Benzoylecgonine and Cocaine: The presence of these substances confirms the patient's use of cocaine, which can exacerbate the risks associated with opioid use, including overdose and cardiovascular complications.
Clinical Significance:

These laboratory findings provide objective evidence supporting the patient's reported substance use. They highlight the severity of her opioid use disorder and the complexity of her substance use pattern, which includes both opioid and stimulant use. The presence of buprenorphine suggests a potential avenue for treatment, as it can be used to manage withdrawal and cravings. However, the patient's ongoing cocaine use poses additional challenges and underscores the need for a comprehensive treatment approach that addresses both opioid and stimulant use.
