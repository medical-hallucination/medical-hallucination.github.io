The image presents a table outlining diagnostic criteria for opioid use disorder, alongside a column describing how each criterion applies to a specific patient. The table is divided into sections: Impaired control, Social impairment, Risky use, and Pharmacologic dependence. Each criterion is listed on the left, with the corresponding patient characteristic on the right.

The table states that the diagnostic criteria are adapted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5). The presence of two or three criteria indicates a mild disorder, four or five criteria a moderate disorder, and six or more criteria a severe disorder.
