Chronological Order of Key Events:
Day Before Presentation:

Sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and mild nonproductive cough.
Severe symptoms prevented the patient from attending work.
Day of Presentation:

Spontaneous improvement in symptoms reported in the morning.
Patient evaluated at a primary care clinic and felt well upon arrival.
Two Years Before Presentation:

Negative screenings for hepatitis C and HIV.
Diagnosed with influenza.
13 Months Before Presentation:

Motor vehicle accident due to falling asleep while driving (first accident).
7 Months Before Presentation:

Second motor vehicle accident, with post-crash muscle spasms in the neck and lower back.
6 Months After Presentation:

Symptoms included poor sleep, low energy, increased appetite, feelings of guilt, and intermittent heightened energy.
History of opioid use disorder revealed, including high oxycodone consumption (120 mg/day).
Follow-Up:

Initially requested naltrexone treatment but could not abstain from opioid use long enough to initiate it.
Later initiated buprenorphine treatment with gradual improvement and sustained remission.
Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions:
Initial Symptoms:

Acute gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) were self-limiting and resolved within a day without specific intervention.
Motor Vehicle Accidents:

Likely related to excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, suggesting an early untreated mood or sleep disorder.
Opioid Use Disorder:

Chronic use of escalating doses of oxycodone contributed to withdrawal symptoms, missed work, and eventual diagnosis of severe opioid use disorder.
Interventions:

Initial naltrexone treatment attempts failed due to challenges with abstinence. Transitioned to buprenorphine treatment with positive outcomes, including sustained remission and return to regular functioning.
Concurrent Mental Health Issues:

Untreated mood symptoms (depression-like) and history of substance use likely exacerbated by her living and work conditions.
