### Chronological Order of Key Events and Temporal Relationships

1. **Middle School:**  
   - Patient began using illicit drugs, including marijuana, oral opioids, cocaine, and MDMA.  
   - **Temporal Note:** Drug use continued for five years.

2. **19 Years of Age:**  
   - Patient became pregnant and discontinued all illicit drug use abruptly.  
   - **Temporal Note:** Abstinence from illicit drugs lasted for eight years.

3. **26 Years of Age (Approximately 3 Years Before Presentation):**  
   - Patient resumed regular use of oral opioids after beginning work at a bar where drugs were available.  
   - Usage escalated to 120 mg of oxycodone per day, costing $3000 monthly.

4. **15 Months Before Presentation:**  
   - Diagnosed with influenza.  
   - **Temporal Note:** Persistent fatigue and excessive sleepiness followed, leading to two motor vehicle accidents.

5. **13 Months Before Presentation:**  
   - First motor vehicle accident: Patient fell asleep while driving.  
   - **Intervention:** No medical attention sought; fatigue continued.

6. **7 Months Before Presentation:**  
   - Second motor vehicle accident: Collision with a turning vehicle.  
   - **Symptoms:** Muscle spasms in neck and lower back; fatigue persisted.  
   - **Intervention:** Prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine; completed outpatient physical therapy.

7. **Date of Presentation (6 Months Before Current Visit):**  
   - Acute symptoms developed: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and mild cough.  
   - Symptoms spontaneously improved before clinic evaluation.  
   - **Intervention:** Oral naltrexone prescribed after patient disclosed nonprescribed oxycodone use and requested injectable naltrexone. Urine toxicology screening ordered, but patient did not follow through.

8. **2 Months After Presentation:**  
   - Patient requested a referral for psychotherapy due to increased stress.  
   - **Intervention:** Referral made.

9. **4 Months After Request for Psychotherapy (6 Months After Presentation):**  
   - Patient evaluated at outpatient psychology clinic.  
   - **Symptoms:** Poor sleep, low energy, increased appetite, guilt, loss of interest, and intermittent heightened energy episodes with pressured speech and racing thoughts.  
   - **Additional History:** Detailed substance use history disclosed.  
   - **Intervention:** Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness exercises, and follow-up scheduled.

10. **7 Months After Presentation:**  
   - Toxicology screening performed at primary care clinic.  
   - **Results:** Positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; negative for fentanyl.  
   - **Diagnosis:** Opioid use disorder with concurrent cocaine use.  
   - **Intervention:** Management plan updated, follow-up scheduled.

### Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions

- **Substance Use and Occupational Context:**  
   Resumption of opioid use correlated with occupational exposure at a bar, eventually escalating to addiction and impacting physical health and work attendance.

- **Fatigue and Sleepiness:**  
   Persistent fatigue after influenza diagnosis led to accidents, highlighting a potential undiagnosed sleep disorder or substance-related fatigue. Management focused on physical recovery (muscle spasms) but missed addressing underlying causes.

- **Substance Use Disclosure and Treatment:**  
   Patient sought naltrexone treatment but failed to complete required abstinence. This indicates difficulty in maintaining abstinence without structured support.

- **Psychological Symptoms and Substance Use:**  
   Depressive and manic symptoms emerged alongside substance use, complicating the clinical picture and necessitating psychological intervention.

- **Management Adjustments Over Time:**  
   Initial focus was on physical recovery and symptomatic relief. Later, the emphasis shifted to addressing substance use and mental health comprehensively.

This chronology provides a structured view of the patient's health journey and highlights areas for focused intervention.
