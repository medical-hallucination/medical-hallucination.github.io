Based on the information provided in the case presentation and the associated diagnostic criteria table for Opioid Use Disorder, the patient exhibits several symptoms that align with the diagnosis of Severe Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), according to DSM-5 criteria. Here's the reasoning:

Diagnostic Criteria for Severe Opioid Use Disorder
The DSM-5 specifies that the presence of six or more criteria indicates a severe disorder. The following criteria from the table and case history are met:

Impaired Control:

The patient has taken opioids in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended: She used escalating amounts of oral oxycodone (120 mg/day).
Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down: She made multiple attempts to stop, including using nonprescribed buprenorphine and requesting naltrexone treatment but was unable to abstain from opioid use long enough to initiate therapy.
A great deal of time spent obtaining or using opioids: She spent $3000 per month on oxycodone and significant time recovering from withdrawal symptoms.
Craving or strong desire to use opioids: She reported increased cravings.
Social Impairment:

Failure to fulfill major obligations: She missed work due to withdrawal symptoms.
Continued use despite social/interpersonal problems: She worried about losing custody of her daughter because of her drug use.
Risky Use:

Recurrent opioid use in physically hazardous situations: She had motor vehicle accidents, likely linked to fatigue and withdrawal symptoms.
Continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems: She reported worsening mood disorders and physical issues related to drug use.
Pharmacologic Dependence:

Tolerance: She used escalating doses of opioids to achieve the desired effect.
Withdrawal: She experienced withdrawal symptoms when unable to use opioids and relied on nonprescribed buprenorphine to manage them.
Possible Diagnosis
The patient meets the criteria for Severe Opioid Use Disorder, given the number and nature of symptoms described. Additionally, the case highlights comorbidities such as depressive symptoms, stress-related issues, and a history of substance use disorders, which should also be addressed in her treatment plan.

Next Steps in Management
Comprehensive Treatment Plan:
Initiation of a structured opioid replacement therapy program (e.g., buprenorphine or methadone).
Addressing co-occurring mental health conditions with cognitive behavioral therapy and possible pharmacologic intervention.
Social support to manage custody concerns and work stress.
Regular follow-ups and toxicology monitoring.
