Below is a consolidated timeline of the patient’s key events and the temporal relationships among her symptoms, evaluations, and treatments. Dates are expressed relative to the “time of presentation” to the primary care clinic for the acute gastrointestinal and flu‐like symptoms.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TWO YEARS BEFORE PRESENTATION  
• Negative screening tests for hepatitis C and HIV.

FIFTEEN MONTHS BEFORE PRESENTATION  
• Diagnosed with influenza.  
• In the months following her influenza infection, she reports persistent fatigue and excessive sleepiness.

THIRTEEN MONTHS BEFORE PRESENTATION (FIRST MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT)  
• Falls asleep at the wheel; crosses into another lane and off the road.  
• Experiences no trauma and does not collide with other vehicles or structures.  

SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE PRESENTATION (SECOND MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT)  
• Collides with a turning vehicle.  
• Experiences neck and low‐back muscle spasms that limit her range of motion.  
• Feels too fatigued to seek care until the following day.  
• Subsequently receives prescriptions for naproxen and cyclobenzaprine.  
• Completes outpatient physical therapy and has diminished muscle spasms.  
• Excessive daytime sleepiness is documented with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 20. She is referred for a formal sleep study.

TIME OF PRESENTATION (DAY 0)  
• Sudden onset (the day before) of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, muscle aches, and mild nonproductive cough.  
• Symptoms improve spontaneously by the time she is seen.  
• Examination and basic tests (including pregnancy test and liver‐function tests) are normal.  
• Patient discloses nonprescribed oxycodone–acetaminophen use and requests injectable naltrexone.  
• Urine toxicology screening is ordered (not completed).  
• Oral naltrexone is prescribed.  
• A follow‐up visit is scheduled for 6 days later (not attended).

TWO MONTHS AFTER PRESENTATION  
• Patient does not complete toxicology screening and misses the follow‐up.  
• She requests a referral for psychotherapy because of increased stress.

SIX MONTHS AFTER PRESENTATION (FOUR MONTHS AFTER PSYCHOTHERAPY REFERRAL)  
• Evaluated at the outpatient psychology clinic.  
• Reports poor sleep, low energy, depressed mood (low interest, guilt, increased appetite, heavy‐leg sensation) and intermittent “up” periods (increased energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, excessive spending).  
• Denies hallucinations or self‐harm ideation.  
• Admits to having resumed illicit drug use 3 years earlier (marijuana, opioids, cocaine, MDMA).  
• States she has tried multiple times to start injectable naltrexone but was unable to abstain long enough to initiate it.  
• Continues with outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises; a follow‐up with her primary care physician is planned.

SEVEN MONTHS AFTER PRESENTATION (ONE MONTH AFTER OUTPATIENT PSYCHOLOGY VISIT)  
• Returns to her primary care physician.  
• Oral‐fluid toxicology screening is positive for oxycodone, buprenorphine, benzoylecgonine, and cocaine; negative for fentanyl.  
• A diagnosis is made, and management decisions follow.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SYMPTOMS AND INTERVENTIONS

• Influenza and Postviral Fatigue: She had documented influenza 15 months prior, followed by prolonged fatigue and sleepiness that contributed to two motor vehicle accidents.  
• Musculoskeletal Symptoms and Treatment: After her second accident (7 months pre‐presentation), she received naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, and physical therapy, which helped diminish neck and back spasms.  
• Acute GI/Flu‐like Symptoms: She presented with sudden onset of GI and respiratory symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, mild cough), which had largely improved spontaneously by the time of evaluation.  
• Opioid Use Disclosure and Initial Naltrexone Attempt: At the time of presentation, she disclosed nonprescribed opioid use and requested injectable naltrexone. Oral naltrexone was prescribed, but she did not pursue toxicology screening or attend the follow‐up.  
• Referral for Psychotherapy: Two months after presentation, she sought help for stress. Four months later (six months after presentation), she underwent a psychiatric evaluation, revealing symptoms suggestive of a mood disorder (alternating low and heightened energy) and ongoing problematic substance use.  
• Persistent Opioid Use and Missed Opportunities for Naltrexone: On multiple occasions, she had tried but failed to initiate injectable naltrexone because she could not remain opioid‐free for the required interval.  
• Final Toxicology Screening: One month after her psychology consultation (seven months after presentation), she tested positive for opioids and stimulants, precipitating diagnostic and management decisions.
