** Analysis of the Clinical Presentation **

This is a complex case of a 29-year-old woman with several key features:

1. Excessive Daytime Sleepiness and Fatigue

* Began shortly after a confirmed influenza infection 15 months prior, followed by “persistent bouts of fatigue and excessive sleepiness.”
* Two motor vehicle accidents attributable to dozing off at the wheel (13 months and 7 months prior).
* An Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 20 (out of 24), suggesting marked daytime somnolence.

2. Mood Symptoms

* Periods of depressed mood characterized by poor sleep, low energy, guilt, increased appetite, and “heavy legs.”
* Intermittent episodes with heightened energy, pressured speech, racing thoughts, and excessive spending—suggestive of (hypo)manic or mixed features.
* No history of psychosis or clear-cut mania requiring hospitalization.

3. Substance Use

* Longstanding history of using multiple illicit substances (opioids, cocaine, MDMA, marijuana) starting in middle school, with a break of several years.
* Resumed opioid use (oral oxycodone) 3 years before presentation, escalating to 120 mg/day with associated financial and social consequences.
* Multiple attempts or partial attempts at medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), including episodes of using nonprescribed buprenorphine and unsuccessful attempts to receive naltrexone.
* Positive toxicology for oxycodone, buprenorphine, and cocaine.

4. Other Medical History

* Exercise-induced asthma, GERD, vitiligo, and genital warts.
* No known family history (the patient was adopted).

5. Social Context

* High-stress environment (two full-time jobs, single mother).
* Tobacco use and moderate alcohol use.

1. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)
The patient clearly meets criteria for Opioid Use Disorder:

* Escalating use (120 mg oxycodone/day)
* Strong cravings and withdrawal (she missed work to avoid withdrawal)
* Significant social and occupational consequences (fear of losing child custody, large financial burden)
* Unsuccessful attempts to quit (tried multiple times to initiate naltrexone; used nonprescribed buprenorphine)

This alone explains a major piece of the picture—her ongoing polysubstance use, difficulties with daily functioning, and concern about withdrawal.

2. Mood Disorder – Likely Bipolar Spectrum
She endorses episodes of depressive symptoms (low mood, guilt, increased appetite, heavy “leaden” feeling in legs, poor sleep) and intermittent periods of hypomanic or manic-like symptoms (heightened energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, excessive spending). The presence of distinct periods of elevated mood and behavior changes—without overt psychosis or hospitalization—leans more toward Bipolar II disorder (i.e., hypomania plus depressive episodes) rather than unipolar major depression or Bipolar I (true mania).

3. Excessive Daytime Sleepiness: Narcolepsy vs. Other Causes
Her daytime somnolence is striking (Epworth score of 20, two “fell asleep at the wheel” accidents). Important differentials include:

* Narcolepsy: Classically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. A post-infectious onset (e.g., after influenza) is well recognized in narcolepsy type 1. However, cataplexy was not clearly described (the “heavy legs” could be atypical cataplexy or part of atypical depression). Ultimately, a formal sleep study (polysomnogram + MSLT) is required to confirm or refute narcolepsy.
* Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): Typically associated with higher BMI or anatomic predispositions; her BMI is 21.9, making OSA less likely (though still possible).
* Sleep Deprivation or Shift-Work Disorder: She works two full-time jobs with presumably chaotic hours, which could lead to chronic partial sleep deprivation.
* Opioid-Induced Sedation: Chronic opioid use can worsen sedation and fatigue.

Given the history of a high Epworth score, the post-influenza onset, and clear episodes of dozing off at the wheel, narcolepsy (especially Type 1, even though cataplexy is not definitively described) is high on the list of possible coexisting conditions. A formal sleep study was recommended, but we do not have those results in the case summary.

** Putting It All Together: The Most Likely Overall Diagnosis **
Given her presentation, the best unifying “set of diagnoses” appears to be:

1. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), severe, with ongoing polysubstance use (cocaine, buprenorphine used nonprescribed, etc.).
2. A Bipolar-Spectrum Disorder (most likely Bipolar II), given her recurrent depressive episodes and clear periods of elevated mood (hypomania).
3. Likely Narcolepsy (or at minimum a significant primary sleep disorder), given the prominent excessive daytime somnolence, high Epworth score, and post-influenza onset. Formal sleep studies are needed to confirm narcolepsy.

** Answer **
Based on the overall clinical picture, laboratory findings, and history, the most plausible overarching diagnoses are:

* Severe Opioid Use Disorder (with polysubstance use),
* Bipolar-spectrum mood disorder (likely Bipolar II), and
* A likely coexisting primary sleep disorder (e.g., narcolepsy), contributing to her excessive daytime sleepiness.

In real-world practice, each of these would need targeted evaluation (formal sleep study for narcolepsy, ongoing psychiatric assessment for bipolar disorder, and evidence-based pharmacotherapy/psychosocial support for opioid use disorder).
