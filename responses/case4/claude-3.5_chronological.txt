Let me break down the timeline of events chronologically:

Day 1: Initial symptoms appear
- Dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue develop

Day 2: No change
- Symptoms persist without resolution

Day 3: First ED visit
- Temperature: 38.8°C
- Initially appears well with clear lung sounds
- CT shows ground-glass opacities in both lungs
- Nasopharyngeal swab taken for SARS-CoV-2 testing
- Prescribed oseltamivir for empirical influenza treatment
- Discharged with instructions to self-quarantine

Days 4-6: Disease progression
- Original symptoms persist
- New symptom develops: dyspnea
- Patient contacts PCP who refers him back to ED

Day 7: Second ED visit and transfer
At local hospital:
- Deteriorating condition with respiratory distress
- Intubation and mechanical ventilation initiated
- Started on:
  - IV propofol
  - cisatracurium
  - cefepime
  - norepinephrine
- Transferred by helicopter to academic center

At academic center:
- Admitted to COVID-19 ICU
- Continues on mechanical ventilation
- Remains febrile (38.9°C)
- Requires ongoing vasopressor support

Key temporal relationships:
1. Time from symptom onset to first medical attention: 2 days
2. Time from first ED visit to second ED visit: 4 days
3. Time from symptom onset to respiratory failure requiring intubation: 6 days
4. Initial symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue) preceded respiratory symptoms (dyspnea) by several days
5. Rapid deterioration occurred between the two ED visits, with oxygen saturation dropping from 97% on room air to 90%, requiring immediate intervention
