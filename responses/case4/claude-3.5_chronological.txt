Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Day -6 (6 days before transfer to academic center):

Initial symptoms develop: dry cough, fever, worsening fatigue

Day -4 (2 days after symptom onset):

First ED visit at local hospital
Vitals: Temperature 38.8°C, BP 94/62, HR 91, RR 12, O2 sat 97% on room air
Appeared well, clear lung sounds
CT chest showed small rounded ground-glass opacities
Prescribed oseltamivir and discharged with instructions to self-quarantine

Day 0 (Day of transfer):

Return to local ED due to persistent symptoms and new dyspnea
Vitals: Temperature 38.6°C, BP 158/91, HR 108, RR 28, O2 sat 90% on room air
Appeared fatigued, tachypneic, and distressed
Decreased breath sounds bilaterally
Intubated and mechanically ventilated
Started on propofol, cisatracurium, cefepime, and norepinephrine
Transferred by helicopter to academic center

Day 1:

SARS-CoV-2 test from first hospital visit returns positive

Day 3:

Developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Started on amiodarone

Day 7:

Improvement in ST-segment elevations
Decline in troponin T levels
Radiographic improvement in bilateral opacities

Days 7-18:

Developed progressive renal failure requiring hemodialysis
Developed metabolic encephalopathy
High-grade fever and leukocytosis suggesting secondary infection
Required escalating pressor support
Improved cardiac function (EF 70%)
Transitioned to comfort measures

Day 18:

Patient died

This timeline shows a rapid progression from initial mild symptoms to severe disease requiring intensive care within about a week, followed by multiple complications over the subsequent two weeks despite some improvement in cardiac function.
