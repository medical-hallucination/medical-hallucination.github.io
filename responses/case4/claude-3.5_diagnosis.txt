Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies, this case strongly suggests COVID-19 with severe complications. Here's the analysis supporting this diagnosis:
Key Clinical Features:

Initial symptoms: Dry cough, fever, fatigue, and progressive dyspnea
Timing: March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic
Patient is a healthcare worker (higher risk group)

Supporting Evidence:
Imaging:

Initial CT shows bilateral ground-glass opacities (classic COVID-19 finding)
Chest X-ray shows progression to extensive bilateral confluent opacities
Pattern is consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia

Laboratory Findings:

Inflammatory markers elevation:


High C-reactive protein (118.2 mg/L)
Elevated ferritin (2695 ng/mL)
Elevated D-dimer (3838 ng/mL)
Elevated LDH (572 U/L)


Hematological changes:


Lymphopenia (11.4%)
Elevated neutrophils (82.2%)
High white blood cell count (18,400/Î¼L)


Cardiac involvement:


Elevated troponin T (4.19 ng/mL)
Elevated NT-proBNP (1298 pg/mL)
New severe global left ventricular hypokinesis on echo

Complications:

Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation
Cardiomyopathy (new onset)
Shock requiring vasopressors (norepinephrine)

This presentation is characteristic of severe COVID-19 with both pulmonary and cardiac complications, which was common during the early pandemic period. The pending SARS-CoV-2 PCR test would confirm this diagnosis, but the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings are highly consistent with COVID-19.
Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this diagnosis or the supporting evidence?
