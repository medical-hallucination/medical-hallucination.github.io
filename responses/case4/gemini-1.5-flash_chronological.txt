Here's a chronological ordering of the key events and temporal relationships:

**Initial Symptoms and Diagnosis**

1. **6 days before transfer:** Dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue develop.
2. **2 days later:** Symptoms persist, leading to emergency department (ED) visit.
3. **ED Visit 1:** 
   * Temperature: 38.8°C
   * Blood pressure: 94/62 mm Hg
   * Heart rate: 91 bpm
   * Respiratory rate: 12 bpm
   * Oxygen saturation: 97% on room air
   * Clear lung sounds
   * Nasopharyngeal swab sent for SARS-CoV-2 testing
   * Oseltamivir prescribed for influenza
   * Discharged home with self-quarantine instructions

**Worsening Condition and Hospitalization**

4. **4 days later:** Persistent symptoms, development of dyspnea.
5. **ED Visit 2:**
   * Temperature: 38.6°C
   * Blood pressure: 158/91 mm Hg
   * Heart rate: 108 bpm
   * Respiratory rate: 28 bpm
   * Oxygen saturation: 90% on room air
   * Fatigue, tachypnea, distress
   * Decreased breath sounds bilaterally
   * Intubated and mechanically ventilated
   * Intravenous medications: propofol, cisatracurium, cefepime, norepinephrine
   * Transferred to academic health center ICU

**Hospitalization and Treatment**

6. **Admission to Academic Health Center ICU:**
   * Temperature: 38.9°C
   * Blood pressure: 100/60 mm Hg on norepinephrine
   * Heart rate: 112 bpm
   * Respiratory rate: 25 bpm
   * Oxygen saturation: 95% on mechanical ventilation
   * Sedated
   * Coarse breath sounds with rhonchi bilaterally
   * Cool, clammy extremities

**Temporal Relationships:**

* The patient's initial symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue) preceded the first ED visit by 6 days.
* The second ED visit and subsequent hospitalization occurred 4 days after the first.
* The patient's condition worsened significantly between the two ED visits, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
* The timing of the SARS-CoV-2 test results is not explicitly stated in the case. 

This chronological overview highlights the rapid progression of the patient's illness and the critical interventions taken to manage his respiratory failure.
