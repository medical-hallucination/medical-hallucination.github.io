Based on the presentation of the case, lab data and images, the patient has COVID-19 pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute cardiac injury.

The patient presented with a cough, fever, worsening fatigue, shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation. A chest CT scan showed ground-glass opacities in both lungs, which is a hallmark of COVID-19 pneumonia. Lab tests showed elevated inflammatory markers and ferritin, which is consistent with COVID-19. Â  

The patient also has risk factors for severe COVID-19, including age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

The patient's acute cardiac injury is evidenced by elevated troponin levels and new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. This could be due to myocardial inflammation caused by COVID-19 or a complication of sepsis.
