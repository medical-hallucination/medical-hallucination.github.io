Based on the provided case presentation, lab data, and images, the most likely diagnosis is **Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia with probable Myopericarditis**.

Here's a breakdown of why:

**Presentation of Case:**

*   **Timeline consistent with COVID-19:** The patient experienced a prodrome of dry cough, fever, and fatigue, followed by worsening dyspnea and hypoxemia, a typical progression for COVID-19. The timing during March 2020, when the pandemic was surging, strongly suggests this.
*   **Initial Presentation:** The initial presentation with fever and dry cough, followed by mild symptoms and clear lung sounds, aligns with early COVID-19 infection.
*  **Rapid Deterioration:** The quick progression to severe respiratory failure necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation is a hallmark of severe COVID-19.
*   **Risk Factors:** The patient's advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and obstructive sleep apnea, as well as being a healthcare worker, all increase his risk for severe COVID-19.
*   **Negative Review of Systems:** Lack of specific symptoms other than cough, fever and dyspnea are common with COVID-19.

**Lab Data:**

*   **Elevated White Blood Cell Count with Neutrophilia:** The significantly elevated WBC (18,400 per Âµl) with predominant neutrophils (82.2%) and decreased lymphocytes (11.4%) indicates an inflammatory response and is typical of COVID-19.
*   **Elevated Inflammatory Markers:**  Elevated CRP (118.2 mg/L) and ferritin (2695 ng/ml) show a robust inflammatory response, common in severe COVID-19.
*   **Elevated Lactate:** Elevated lactate levels (3.5 mmol/L) indicates tissue hypoperfusion, possibly from the severity of the pneumonia, sepsis or heart failure.
*   **Elevated D-dimer:** The markedly elevated D-dimer level (3838 ng/ml) raises concern for a hypercoagulable state, which is associated with severe COVID-19 and may also suggest concurrent VTE (Venous Thromboembolism) or PE (Pulmonary Embolism).
*   **Elevated Troponin T:** The elevated Troponin T level (4.19 ng/mL) suggests myocardial injury, raising concern for myopericarditis.
*   **Arterial Blood Gases:** The arterial blood gas analysis on admission showed respiratory failure (pH 7.29 and PaO2 118 while on 100% oxygen)
*   **Elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide** The elevated NT-proBNP suggests some degree of cardiac strain, possibly due to heart failure or myopericarditis.

**Imaging:**

*   **Initial CT Chest:** The CT scan in Panel A shows scattered ground-glass opacities, which are highly suggestive of COVID-19. The central and peripheral distribution is typical.
*   **Follow Up Chest X-Ray:** The chest radiograph in Panel B demonstrates extensive confluent parenchymal opacities bilaterally, indicative of a progression of the pneumonia and also seen in severe COVID-19.

**Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

*   **Initial ECG Changes (Panel A):** ECG showing left atrial abnormality, a borderline prolonged PR interval, ST-segment depressions of 1 mm in the inferior leads, ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in leads I and aVL, and PR-segment depression in lead II and PR-segment elevation in lead aVR. The ST-segment elevation raises possibility of coronary occlusion, but PR-segment deflections suggest pericardial irritation, possibly consistent with myopericarditis.
*  **Subsequent ECG Changes (Panels B, C, and D):** show progression of the ECG changes, with persistent ST-segment elevations in leads I and aVL (Panel B), Atrial Fibrillation with high ventricular rate and persistent ST segment elevations (Panel C), regional T-wave inversion and a reduction in R-wave voltage in lead aVL (Panel D) are present, findings that could be consistent with transmural necrosis. The changes overall, suggest myocarditis with possible transmural necrosis.
*  **QTC prolongation:** The QTc prolongation on the ECG panels also supports myocarditis as a possible underlying cause.

**Differential Diagnosis:**

*   **Influenza:** Although Oseltamivir was initially prescribed empirically, the lack of testing and subsequent deterioration make influenza less likely.  Furthermore, the chest CT findings are more typical of COVID-19 than influenza.
*   **Bacterial Pneumonia:** While bacterial pneumonia could cause a similar clinical picture, the lack of specific findings in the initial exam and the initial clinical presentation are less suggestive of it being a primary cause, but can be seen as a secondary infection.
*   **Other Viral Pneumonias:** Other viral pneumonias can cause similar symptoms, but given the timing of the case, COVID-19 remains most probable.
* **Pulmonary Embolism:** With the significant rise in D-dimer, pulmonary embolism is a differential to consider, but this diagnosis does not explain the other symptoms or images seen in this case.

**Conclusion:**

The constellation of findings, particularly the clinical history, the ground-glass opacities on CT, and the inflammatory lab markers, along with ECG changes, makes **Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia** the most likely diagnosis. The elevated Troponin T and ECG changes strongly support the presence of **Myopericarditis** as a complication. While the possibility of a concurrent VTE (Venous Thromboembolism) or PE (Pulmonary Embolism) cannot be excluded, the primary diagnosis is severe COVID-19 pneumonia with possible myopericarditis.

It is important to note that this analysis is based on the provided information, and a definitive diagnosis would ideally require the results of a confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. However, based on all the evidence provided, the possible diagnosis is Severe COVID-19 Pneumonia with probable Myopericarditis.
