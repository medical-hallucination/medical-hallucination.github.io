Here is a chronological order of key events and the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

### **Timeline of Key Events**

1. **Usual State of Health**  
   - The patient was in his usual state of health until **6 days prior to transfer**.

2. **Day 1 (6 Days Before Transfer)**  
   - **Symptoms onset:** Dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue developed.

3. **Day 3 (4 Days Before Transfer)**  
   - **Symptoms persisted:** Fever and fatigue continued.  
   - **Emergency department visit:**  
     - **Vitals:** Temperature 38.8°C, BP 94/62 mm Hg, HR 91 bpm, RR 12 breaths/min, O2 saturation 97% on ambient air.  
     - **Examination:** Well-appearing, clear lung sounds.  
     - **Diagnostics:**  
       - White-cell count 5600/μL (56% neutrophils, 33% lymphocytes).  
       - Nasopharyngeal swab sent for SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing.  
       - CT chest: Rounded ground-glass opacities (1–1.5 cm) in both lungs.  
     - **Intervention:** Prescribed oseltamivir for empirical influenza treatment.  
   - **Discharged home:** Patient instructed to self-quarantine.

4. **Day 7 (Day of Transfer)**  
   - **Dyspnea and worsening symptoms:**  
     - Referred back to the emergency department.  
   - **Emergency department visit:**  
     - **Vitals:** Temperature 38.6°C, BP 158/91 mm Hg, HR 108 bpm, RR 28 breaths/min, O2 saturation 90% on ambient air.  
     - **Examination:** Fatigued, tachypneic, and distressed. Decreased bilateral breath sounds on auscultation.  
   - **Interventions:**  
     - Intubated for mechanical ventilation.  
     - Administered intravenous propofol, cisatracurium, cefepime, and norepinephrine.  
     - Transferred by helicopter to the ICU at an academic health center in Boston.

5. **Post-Transfer to ICU (Day 7 Continued)**  
   - **Patient arrival:**  
     - **Vitals:** Temperature 38.9°C, BP 100/60 mm Hg (on norepinephrine), HR 112 bpm, RR 25 breaths/min, O2 saturation 95% on mechanical ventilation.  
     - **Mechanical ventilation settings:** PEEP 5 cm H2O, tidal volume 410 mL, FiO₂ 1.0.  
     - **Examination:** Sedated, tachycardic rhythm without murmur, coarse breath sounds with rhonchi, cool and clammy extremities.  
   - **Family-provided medical history:** Hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, prior aortic-valve replacement, atrial flutter ablation, and right shoulder arthroplasty.  
   - **Social history:** No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit substance use; no known sick contacts or recent travel.

### **Temporal Relationships**

- **Symptoms → First ED visit:**  
   - Symptoms began 6 days before transfer and persisted for 2 days before the first ED visit. At this visit, imaging suggested early lung involvement (ground-glass opacities), and empirical treatment for influenza was initiated.

- **Symptoms Worsened → Second ED visit:**  
   - Symptoms persisted for 4 additional days after the first ED visit. Dyspnea and significant hypoxemia prompted the second ED visit.

- **Intubation → ICU Transfer:**  
   - Hypoxemia and respiratory distress led to immediate intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation. After stabilization, the patient was transferred to a higher-level academic health center for further management.

- **ICU Admission → Evaluation and Ongoing Care:**  
   - Upon ICU admission, the patient exhibited continued respiratory distress despite mechanical ventilation and sedation. Advanced care measures, including norepinephrine for circulatory support, were employed. 

This sequence highlights the progressive nature of the patient's illness and the escalating interventions to manage acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to suspected Covid-19.
