Key Events Chronologically:
Initial Symptoms:

The patient, a 73-year-old man, developed a dry cough, fever, and worsening fatigue six days before hospitalization.
First Hospital Visit:

Two days after symptom onset, the patient visited the emergency department with fever (38.8°C) and normal oxygen saturation (97%). He was treated empirically with oseltamivir and discharged with instructions to self-quarantine.
Symptom Progression and Second Hospital Visit:

Symptoms persisted, and dyspnea developed four days later, prompting another emergency department visit. The patient’s oxygen saturation had dropped to 90%, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. He was transferred to an ICU in Boston.
Initial ICU Admission:

On arrival, the patient had hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. His temperature was 38.9°C, and he was sedated and ventilated.
Clinical and Diagnostic Findings:

Imaging showed ground-glass opacities and pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS.
Laboratory results indicated elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, ferritin, and IL-6) and elevated troponin T, suggesting cardiac injury.
Echocardiography showed global biventricular hypokinesis without coronary artery disease, raising suspicion of myopericarditis.
Interventions Initiated:

Empirical treatments included hydroxychloroquine, immune globulin, and supportive care. Intravenous antibiotics and vasopressors were administered.
QTc monitoring was implemented due to the risk of QT prolongation with hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical Complications:

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation developed on day 3 of ICU stay, treated with intravenous amiodarone.
Renal failure necessitated intermittent hemodialysis, and metabolic encephalopathy was observed.
Transition to Comfort Care:

Despite intensive care, the patient’s condition deteriorated with escalating pressor requirements and suspected secondary bacterial infection. After discussions with the family, he was transitioned to comfort care and died on day 18.
Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions:
Cough and Fever (Initial Symptoms): Preceded the onset of hypoxemia, potentially indicating a viral etiology (later confirmed as COVID-19).
Hypoxemia and Dyspnea: Led to ICU admission, where ventilatory support was initiated.
Elevated Inflammatory Markers and Cardiac Dysfunction: Coincided with imaging findings consistent with ARDS and myopericarditis, influencing the choice of anti-inflammatory and supportive therapies.
Atrial Fibrillation: Likely secondary to the combined stress of critical illness, hypoxemia, and systemic inflammation.
Renal Failure: Developed as a late complication, further complicating the management of the patient’s critical illness.
This case illustrates the complex interplay between the patient’s underlying conditions, the progression of COVID-19, and the challenges in managing critical complications like ARDS and myopericarditis.
