Given the clinical presentation (progressive cough, fever, fatigue, and dyspnea), the imaging findings (widespread bilateral ground‐glass opacities on CT that evolved into diffuse confluent opacities on chest radiograph), and the laboratory profile (marked inflammatory markers, elevated d‐dimer, and evidence of multi‐organ stress), the most likely unifying diagnosis is severe COVID‑19 pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
