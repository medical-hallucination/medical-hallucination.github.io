Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events, starting from the earliest:

3 months before presentation:
- 8 cm nonpruritic, nonpainful erythema on left gluteal fold appears
- Thought to be an insect bite
- Resolves over 4 weeks

10 weeks before presentation:
- Develops back pain between shoulder blades
- Pain resolves over 2 weeks without intervention

6 weeks before presentation:
- Develops numbness in bandlike pattern around trunk
- Includes area under breasts

5 weeks before presentation:
- Numbness extends to upper abdomen
- Develops difficulty sitting up without arm support
- Experiences abdominal distention

4 weeks before presentation:
- Develops paresthesia in some fingers of both hands

2 weeks before presentation:
- Numbness spreads to genital area
- Develops urinary incontinence
- Visits emergency department
- Initial workup including MRI without contrast shows no significant findings

5 days before final neurology visit:
- Develops new numbness in upper anterior legs
- Difficulty lifting front of left foot
- Reports breathing and coughing difficulties

At final neurology visit:
- Previous symptoms persist
- Shows muscle weakness in specific areas (4/5 in left wrist flexion, left foot dorsiflexion, left toe extension)
- Diminished sensation T6-T12 dermatomes
- Absent reflexes (left biceps, bilateral ankles)
- High glycated hemoglobin (11.8%)
- Additional imaging including contrast MRI shows no new findings

The pattern shows a progressive ascending neurological disorder that began with back pain, followed by sensory symptoms (numbness, paresthesia) starting at the trunk and moving both upward and downward, then progressing to motor symptoms (weakness) and autonomic dysfunction (urinary incontinence). The temporal progression suggests a systematic spread of the underlying pathological process.
