Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Initial Phase (3 months before presentation):

Patient noticed an 8cm diameter erythematous, non-pruritic, non-painful rash on left gluteal fold, thought to be an insect bite
Rash resolved over subsequent 4 weeks

Disease Progression:
10 weeks before presentation:

Back pain developed between shoulder blades
Pain resolved within 2 weeks without intervention

6 weeks before presentation:

Numbness developed in bandlike distribution around trunk (between shoulder blades and under breasts)

5 weeks before presentation:

Numbness extended to upper abdomen
Became unable to sit up without using arms
Developed abdominal distention

4 weeks before presentation:

Paresthesia developed in fingers (left hand: 3rd, 4th, 5th; right hand: 4th, 5th)
Seen at another clinic and MRI scheduled

2 weeks before presentation:

Numbness extended to genital area
Developed urinary incontinence
Presented to emergency department
Initial MRI showed no significant findings

At neurology clinic presentation:

New symptoms: difficulty lifting left foot and taking deep breaths
Found to have elevated glucose (291 mg/dL) and HbA1c (11.8%)
CSF analysis revealed:

Elevated protein (128 mg/dL)
Elevated nucleated cells (46/mmÂ³)
Elevated glucose (115 mg/dL)


Diagnosed with Lyme meningoradiculitis

Treatment and Follow-up:

Received 3-week course of IV ceftriaxone
At 4 months post-treatment:

Pain diminished over 4-week period
Improved but residual abdominal wall weakness
Improved but continuing difficulty with left foot movement



The progression shows an ascending pattern of neurological symptoms over approximately 3 months, beginning with what was likely an erythema migrans rash (characteristic of early Lyme disease), followed by progressive radicular symptoms moving from the trunk to the extremities.
