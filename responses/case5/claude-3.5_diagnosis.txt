Let me analyze this case systematically:
Key Clinical Features:

58-year-old woman with ascending neurological symptoms over 10 weeks
Initial symptoms:

Back pain between shoulder blades
Bandlike trunk numbness (T6-T12 dermatomes)
Progressive ascending sensory symptoms
Urinary incontinence
Weakness in specific muscle groups (4/5 strength)
Absent reflexes (left biceps, bilateral ankles)



Important Historical Clues:

Erythema migrans-like lesion (8cm nonpruritic, nonpainful erythema) on gluteal fold 3 months prior
Lives in northeastern Connecticut (endemic area for tick-borne diseases)

Notable Test Results:

High blood glucose (291 mg/dL) and HbA1c (11.8%) suggesting undiagnosed diabetes
Normal inflammatory markers
Normal MRI findings without cord compression or enhancement

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme neuroborreliosis (Lyme radiculoneuritis), specifically:

The geographic location (northeastern Connecticut) is endemic for Lyme disease
Historical evidence of possible erythema migrans (tick bite)
Clinical presentation matches Lyme radiculoneuritis:

Progressive ascending sensory symptoms
Multiple radicular involvement
Asymmetric muscle weakness
Areflexia
Normal MRI findings (typical in early Lyme neuroborreliosis)



The patient's symptoms suggest both peripheral nerve and spinal cord involvement, which is characteristic of Lyme disease. The diagnostic test mentioned at the end would likely be CSF analysis and Lyme serology to confirm the diagnosis.
Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this analysis?
