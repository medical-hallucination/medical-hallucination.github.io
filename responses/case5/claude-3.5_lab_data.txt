Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

Initial Blood Tests in Emergency Department:


Glucose: 291 mg/dL (Normal: 70-110 mg/dL)
HbA1c: 11.8% (Normal: <5.7%)


Clinical Significance:

Revealed previously undiagnosed diabetes
While relevant for patient's health, the acute hyperglycemia was not the primary cause of neurological symptoms
Pattern of symptoms was inconsistent with diabetic polyradiculopathy




Inflammatory Markers:


ESR: 25 mm/hr (Normal: <30)


Clinical Significance:

Normal ESR helped rule out inflammatory conditions like vasculitis
Supported an infectious rather than autoimmune process




CSF Analysis:


Glucose: 115 mg/dL (Normal: 50-75 mg/dL)
Total protein: 128 mg/dL (Normal: 5-55 mg/dL)
Nucleated cells: 46/mmÂ³ (Normal: 0-5)


Clinical Significance:

Elevated protein and pleocytosis typical of Lyme meningoradiculitis
Pattern suggests inflammatory process affecting meninges and nerve roots
Findings consistent with early disseminated Lyme disease




Lyme Disease Testing:


First-tier ELISA: Reactive
IgM Immunoblot: 1/3 bands positive (negative per CDC criteria)
IgG Immunoblot: 9/10 bands positive (positive per CDC criteria)


Clinical Significance:

Pattern indicates established B. burgdorferi infection of 1-2 months duration
IgM to IgG class switch suggests progression from early to disseminated disease
Correlates well with clinical timeline from initial rash




CSF Lyme Testing:


CSF IgG immunoblot: 5 specific bands
CSF IgM immunoblot: No bands
PCR for Borrelia species: Negative


Clinical Significance:

CSF testing was not necessary for diagnosis given positive serology and classic symptoms
Negative PCR does not rule out infection due to poor sensitivity
Band patterns on CSF immunoblots are non-contributory for diagnosis



The laboratory findings support the diagnosis of Lyme meningoradiculitis by:

Ruling out other causes (normal ESR, pattern inconsistent with diabetes)
Showing evidence of CNS inflammation (CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein)
Confirming B. burgdorferi infection with appropriate serologic progression
Matching the clinical timeline from initial infection to neurologic symptoms

This comprehensive laboratory evaluation helped establish the diagnosis and guided appropriate treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone, leading to clinical improvement.
