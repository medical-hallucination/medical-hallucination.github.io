Possible Diagnosis:

Based on the patient's presentation, lab data, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is Transverse Myelitis.

Supporting Evidence:

Progressive neurological symptoms: The patient presented with a progressive course of sensory and motor deficits, including numbness, weakness, and respiratory involvement.
Sensory level: The presence of a sensory level at T6-T12 is highly suggestive of a spinal cord lesion.
MRI findings: Although the MRI did not show significant cord signal abnormalities or contrast enhancement, it is important to note that MRI can be normal in early stages of transverse myelitis.
Laboratory findings: The elevated glycated hemoglobin suggests uncontrolled diabetes, a known risk factor for transverse myelitis.
Other Considerations:

Spinal cord tumor: While less likely given the MRI findings, a spinal cord tumor cannot be completely ruled out.
Infections: Infections such as viral or bacterial meningitis can present with similar symptoms, but the absence of fever and other systemic signs makes this less likely.
Next Steps:

To confirm the diagnosis of transverse myelitis, further diagnostic tests may be considered:

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis: To look for inflammatory markers and evidence of infection.
Evoked potentials: To assess the function of the sensory and motor pathways.
Muscle biopsy: In some cases, to rule out inflammatory myopathies.
Treatment:

Treatment for transverse myelitis typically involves:

High-dose corticosteroids: To reduce inflammation.
Immunomodulatory therapy: To target the underlying immune response.
Supportive care: Including pain management, bladder and bowel management, and respiratory support as needed.
Prognosis:

The prognosis for transverse myelitis varies depending on the underlying cause and the severity of the initial presentation. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve the chances of recovery.
