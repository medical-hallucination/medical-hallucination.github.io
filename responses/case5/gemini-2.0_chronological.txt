Okay, here's a chronological breakdown of the key events, symptoms, and interventions, along with temporal relationships:

**Timeline of Events, Symptoms, and Interventions**

*   **Approximately 3 Months Before Presentation:**
    *   **Event:** Patient noticed an 8 cm area of nonpruritic, nonpainful erythema on her left gluteal fold, thought to be an insect bite.
    *   **Symptom:** Erythema on left gluteal fold.
    *   **Resolution:** Resolved over 4 weeks without intervention.
*   **Approximately 10 Weeks Before Presentation:**
    *   **Symptom:** Back pain between her shoulder blades.
    *   **Resolution:** Resolved over 2 weeks without intervention.
*   **Approximately 6 Weeks Before Presentation:**
    *   **Symptom:** Numbness in a band-like pattern around her trunk, including the area under her breasts.
*   **Approximately 5 Weeks Before Presentation:**
    *   **Symptom:** Numbness extended to the upper abdomen, difficulty sitting up from a supine position without arm support, and abdominal distention.
*   **Approximately 4 Weeks Before Presentation:**
    *   **Symptom:** Paresthesia in some fingers of both hands.
*   **Approximately 2 Weeks Before Presentation:**
    *   **Symptom:** Numbness spread to the genital area, and she developed urinary incontinence.
    *   **Intervention:**  Emergency department visit. Initial evaluation, including blood work and imaging.
        * **Findings:**  Hyperglycemia (291 mg/dL), normal renal and liver function, blood cell counts, and electrolytes. MRIs of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine (without contrast) showed no spinal cord compression or abnormalities, only degenerative changes and prior surgical changes. 
        *   **Temporal Relationship:** Urinary incontinence directly prompted the ED visit.
*   **Approximately 5 Days Before Further Neurological Evaluation (approximately 2 weeks after initial ED visit)**
    *   **Symptom:** New numbness in the upper anterior legs, difficulty lifting the front of her left foot, breathing and coughing difficulties.
*   **Further Neurological Evaluation (within 2 weeks of ED Visit):**
    * **Findings:**  Strength testing showed 4/5 in left wrist flexion, 4/5 in left foot dorsiflexion, and 4/5 in left toe extension, reduced tone of the rectus abdominis muscles, and diminished sensation to light touch and pinprick from T6 to T12 dermatomes. Biceps reflexes were absent on the left, and ankle reflexes were absent bilaterally. High glycated hemoglobin level. 
    * **Intervention:** Further imaging and testing.
    * **Findings:**  Chest X-rays showed no issues. Thoracic and lumbar MRI (without and with contrast) were stable compared to previous imaging.
*   **Following Neurological Evaluation**
     *   **Intervention:** A diagnostic test was performed. 

**Temporal Relationships - Key Observations:**

*   **Gradual Onset of Neurological Symptoms:** The symptoms developed sequentially, starting with back pain, then progressing to numbness in the trunk, abdomen, hands, genital area, and legs, followed by weakness and gait changes.
*   **Symptom Progression:** There is a clear progression of numbness, first trunkal, then peripheral, with the addition of motor deficits at the end.
*   **Urinary Incontinence as Prompt:** Urinary incontinence was the symptom that prompted the initial emergency department visit, indicating a significant worsening of the condition.
*   **No Initial Spinal Cord Compression:** The initial MRIs ruled out spinal cord compression as a cause, suggesting a different underlying issue.
* **Initial Erythema Not Linked To Main Presentation**: The resolution of erythema on the gluteal fold without interventions appears temporally separate from the later symptoms which began 3 months later, and thus does not appear causally linked.

**Summary of Temporal Patterns:**

The patient experienced a progression of neurological symptoms over several weeks, starting with back pain and progressing to numbness, weakness, and gait changes, ultimately culminating in urinary incontinence and difficulty breathing, which prompted medical attention. The initial spinal imaging was unrevealing.

This timeline highlights the importance of carefully tracking symptom development and the relationship between symptoms and interventions to aid in differential diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
