Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and the provided MRI images, the most likely diagnosis is **Transverse Myelitis** secondary to underlying **Diabetes Mellitus**. Here's a breakdown of why:

**Clinical Presentation:**

*   **Subacute onset of neurological symptoms:** The patient developed back pain that resolved, followed by a progressive band-like numbness across the trunk, progressing to the abdomen, then paresthesia in the hands and numbness extending down to the genital area. This ascending pattern of neurological symptoms is suggestive of a spinal cord issue.
*   **Motor weakness:**  The patient developed left foot drop, mild weakness in the left wrist and foot, and reduced abdominal tone. This localized weakness combined with the sensory deficits points to spinal cord involvement.
*   **Autonomic dysfunction:** The development of urinary incontinence and difficulty in sitting up are both indicative of autonomic dysfunction, which can occur with spinal cord lesions.
*   **Respiratory symptoms:** Breathing and coughing difficulties, along with diminished diaphragmatic excursion, can indicate a lesion in the mid-thoracic spinal cord, affecting the diaphragm and abdominal muscles.
* **Absence of upper motor neuron findings:** the absence of hyperreflexia, spasticity and presence of areflexia, is more suggestive of lower motor neuron and spinal cord involvement.

**Imaging Findings:**

*   **Normal Spinal MRI:** The MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine showed no compression, signal abnormalities, or epidural collections which would suggest spinal cord compression or space-occupying lesions. 
*   The thoracic MRI with and without contrast showed no abnormalities, no enhancement, ruling out tumors, inflammation, infection, and vascular problems.

**Lab Data:**

*   **Significantly Elevated Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c):** The HbA1c of 11.8% indicates poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. High blood sugar is known to cause microvascular problems that can lead to neurological deficits, and diabetes is a common cause of neuropathy. However, this does not usually present as a transverse myelitis. It is possible that the patient has a different autoimmune process that is exasperated by underlying diabetes.
*   **Normal inflammatory markers:** The ESR, was normal, indicating no active inflammation that could point towards other causes of myelitis.
*   **Normal vitamin and thyroid levels:** This helps rule out other metabolic and hormonal problems which could manifest in neurological problems.
*   **Normal renal and hepatic function, and blood cell counts:** This suggests no metabolic issues besides hyperglycemia.

**Why this diagnosis?**

*   **Transverse Myelitis** This explains the band-like sensory loss, weakness, autonomic issues, and respiratory symptoms, indicating a spinal cord lesion. The ascending pattern is not typical of multiple sclerosis or acute demyelination.
*   **Excluding alternative diagnoses:** The normal MRIs, especially with contrast, exclude spinal cord compression, epidural collections, tumors, or significant spinal stenosis. Normal labs ruled out other possible infections.

**The role of Diabetes**

*   **Diabetes as a potential risk factor:** While diabetic neuropathy typically presents with a distal, stocking-glove pattern, poorly controlled diabetes has been reported in some cases of transverse myelitis. This is likely through some autoimmune mechanism triggered by the hyperglycemia.

**Other Possible (Less Likely) Considerations:**

*   **Autoimmune Myelitis:**  While the presentation is suggestive of an autoimmune etiology, the normal ESR and negative inflammatory markers are not supportive of an inflammatory autoimmune process.
*   **Paraneoplastic Syndrome:** While these can cause rapidly progressing myelitis, they are rare, and in general the lack of any other oncological history and the normal chest x-ray make this unlikely.

**Next Steps:**

The diagnostic test mentioned in the case description should shed further light on the precise diagnosis and help guide treatment.

**In summary, based on the progressive band-like sensory and motor deficits, associated autonomic symptoms and absence of compressive findings on MRI, in the context of poorly controlled diabetes, a diagnosis of Transverse Myelitis secondary to underlying poorly controlled diabetes is the most probable diagnosis.**
