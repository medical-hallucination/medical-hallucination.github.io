Chronological Order of Key Events and Temporal Relationships in the Case:
Three months prior:

Patient noticed an area of erythema (8 cm diameter) on the left gluteal fold, which she attributed to an insect bite. The erythema resolved over four weeks without further symptoms.
Ten weeks prior:

Back pain developed between the shoulder blades. The pain resolved within two weeks without intervention.
Six weeks prior:

Numbness appeared in a bandlike distribution around the trunk, involving the area between the shoulder blades and beneath the breasts.
Five weeks prior:

Numbness extended to the upper abdomen.
Patient experienced abdominal distention and difficulty sitting up without using her arms.
Four weeks prior:

Paresthesia developed in fingers (third, fourth, and fifth of the left hand; fourth and fifth of the right hand).
An MRI was scheduled at another hospital.
Two weeks prior:

Numbness extended to the genital area, and urinary incontinence developed.
Patient presented to the emergency department.
At presentation to the ED:

Stable paresthesia of the hands and numbness in the trunk and abdomen.
New numbness in the anterior legs and a five-day history of difficulty lifting the left foot when walking.
Difficulty taking a deep breath and coughing.
Imaging studies, including MRI, showed no significant abnormalities.
Diagnostic investigations:

Elevated blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels indicated diabetes.
Lumbar puncture revealed elevated total protein and a nucleated cell count, suggesting inflammation.
Serologic tests confirmed Lyme meningoradiculitis.
Treatment and follow-up:

The patient received a three-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone and diabetes management with insulin and metformin.
Symptoms improved, including reduced pain and increased abdominal wall strength, but residual difficulties remained with certain activities (e.g., walking on the heel).
Temporal Relationships:
The progression from back pain to truncal numbness and paresthesia, followed by genital involvement and motor weakness, suggests a sequential spread of neurologic involvement.
The earlier erythema aligns with Lyme disease, indicating the initial infection may have triggered the neurologic manifestations after a latency period.
Treatment began after the diagnosis, and symptom improvement supports the diagnosis of Lyme meningoradiculitis.
