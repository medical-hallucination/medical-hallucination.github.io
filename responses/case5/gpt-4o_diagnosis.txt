Based on the presentation of symptoms including hypoesthesia, paresthesia, weakness, and autonomic dysfunction, combined with the MRI findings that show no evidence of spinal cord compression or abnormalities, a possible diagnosis could be a demyelinating disease such as transverse myelitis. This condition can cause sensory and motor deficits and may align with the patient's symptoms of numbness, weakness, and autonomic dysfunction (like urinary incontinence).

Additionally, the presence of a preceding skin lesion could suggest some form of infectious or post-infectious condition, which is sometimes associated with transverse myelitis. Given her history and presentation, other possibilities to consider include neuropathic conditions secondary to diabetes (noting her high glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin) or a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Further diagnostic tests, such as a lumbar puncture to examine cerebrospinal fluid or additional blood tests for autoimmune markers, might be necessary to refine the diagnosis.
