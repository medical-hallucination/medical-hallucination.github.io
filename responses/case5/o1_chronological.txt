Below is a summary of the patient’s course, organized by time since presentation and highlighting how symptoms evolved and when key evaluations or interventions were undertaken.

• Three months before presentation  
  – Developed an 8‑cm area of nonpruritic, nonpainful erythema on the left gluteal fold, suspected to be an insect bite.  
  – This rash resolved spontaneously over about four weeks.  

• Ten weeks before presentation  
  – Began experiencing back pain between the shoulder blades, which resolved without specific treatment over two weeks.  

• Six weeks before presentation  
  – Noted numbness in a bandlike distribution around her trunk (under her breasts).  

• Five weeks before presentation  
  – Numbness spread to her upper abdomen.  
  – Difficulty sitting up from a supine position without arm support.  
  – Abdominal distention became noticeable.  

• Four weeks before presentation  
  – Paresthesia developed in some fingers of both hands.  

• Two weeks before presentation  
  – Numbness extended to the genital region.  
  – New onset of urinary incontinence prompted her first visit to the emergency department (ED).  
     ◦ In the ED, she reported no fevers, night sweats, weight changes, or new motor deficits.  

• At the emergency department visit  
  – Laboratory tests showed elevated blood glucose (291 mg/dL) but otherwise normal renal, liver, and blood counts.  
  – MRI (cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine without contrast) demonstrated no spinal cord compression, no cord signal abnormality, and no evidence of epidural collections.  
  – She was discharged with instructions to pursue further outpatient neurology evaluation because no definitive cause was identified in the ED.  

• Subsequent neurology follow-up (shortly before presentation)  
  – Persistent trunk and abdominal numbness, stable hand paresthesia.  
  – New numbness in the upper anterior legs and foot-drop-like weakness (inability to dorsiflex left foot) evolving over the previous five days.  
  – Notable breathing and coughing difficulties.  

• Neurologic examination and repeat imaging  
  – Examination revealed mild weakness in left wrist flexion and in left foot dorsiflexion/toe extension, reduced tone in bilateral rectus abdominis, and diminished sensation in T6–T12 dermatomes.  
  – Absent left biceps reflex and bilateral ankle reflexes.  
  – Additional spine MRI (thoracic and lumbar without contrast) was stable; contrast-enhanced thoracic MRI revealed no abnormal enhancements.  
  – Chest X‑ray showed normal hemidiaphragmatic movement.  
  – Laboratory work revealed markedly elevated glycated hemoglobin (11.8%), but otherwise normal ESR, TSH, creatine kinase, vitamin D, B12, and folate levels.  

• Diagnostic intervention (shortly after the second round of imaging)  
  – Because imaging remained unrevealing, further diagnostic testing (likely a lumbar puncture and/or nerve conduction studies) was pursued to elucidate the etiology of her progressive neuropathic symptoms.  

In summary, the patient’s primary symptoms (progressive trunk and limb sensory disturbances, weakness, and urinary incontinence) began roughly 10 weeks prior to the neurology clinic visit. They prompted her to seek ED care two weeks before formal neurological assessment, at which time initial spine imaging was obtained. When symptoms persisted and evolved (particularly weakness in the left foot and concerns about respiratory effort), repeat imaging with contrast failed to show a structural lesion, leading to additional diagnostic testing.
