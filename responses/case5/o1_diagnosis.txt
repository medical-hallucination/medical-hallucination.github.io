A unifying clue in this presentation is the large “insect bite” lesion on the patient’s left gluteal fold several weeks before onset of subacute, bandlike trunk numbness, upper‐ and lower‐limb paresthesias, and radiculopathy‐level weakness—all in a resident of tick‐endemic northeastern Connecticut. Normal spinal MRIs rule out compressive or intrinsic spinal cord pathology, and the spread of symptoms across multiple nerve‐root levels (with both sensory and motor involvement, plus urinary incontinence) points toward polyradiculopathy rather than a focal lesion.

Taken together, these features strongly suggest Lyme neuroborreliosis (i.e., Lyme polyradiculopathy) as the most likely diagnosis. The nonpruritic, nonpainful 8‐cm erythema that spontaneously resolved is classic for an erythema migrans lesion, which often heralds Lyme infection. Although diabetic radiculopathy, Guillain–Barré syndrome variants, or other causes of polyradiculopathy could be considered, the combination of geographic exposure risk, preceding rash, and the clinical/radiologic pattern makes Lyme neuroborreliosis the prime suspect.
