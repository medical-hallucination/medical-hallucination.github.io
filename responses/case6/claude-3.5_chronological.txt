Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events and interventions in this case:
Initial Symptoms and Presentation:

Day -6: Development of right frontal headache and right retro-orbital pain (atypical for patient's previous migraines)
Day -5: Woke up with "gray dot" in inferonasal field of right eye vision; later developed intermittent "white appearing" vision loss lasting 45-60 seconds
Day -3: Onset of vertigo episodes lasting ~30 seconds each; experienced intermittent nonpositional bifrontal headaches
Day -1: Went to affiliated ophthalmology hospital
Day 0: Transfer to main hospital

Hospital Course and New Symptoms:
6. Day +1: Development of right ear hearing loss and tinnitus
7. Day +4: Fluorescein angiography performed showing vascular abnormalities
Follow-up and Treatment:
8. Initial treatment included:

IV methylprednisolone
1-month course of high-dose oral prednisone followed by slow taper
Four weekly doses of rituximab

Long-term Monitoring:
9. Surveillance included:

Fluorescein angiography at 1 week, 7 months, 17 months, and 23 months
MRI at 3, 15, and 20 months
Audiometry at diagnosis and 7 months later

Treatment Adjustments:
10. Maintenance therapy changes:

Started on rituximab + mycophenolate
Mycophenolate discontinued due to myalgias
Switched to azathioprine
Azathioprine discontinued after 1 year due to elevated liver enzymes
Continued on rituximab monotherapy for 15+ months without relapse

The disease progression followed a rapid course over approximately one week from initial headache to development of the full triad of symptoms (visual, auditory, and vestibular) characteristic of Susac's syndrome. The treatment response was described as rapid, and the patient maintained stability on rituximab monotherapy, though with some mild progression of hearing loss noted at 7 months despite being clinically asymptomatic.
