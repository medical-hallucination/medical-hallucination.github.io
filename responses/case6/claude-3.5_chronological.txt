Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events:

Day -16 years:
- Patient's history of migraines without aura begins (occurring every 1-3 months)

Day -6 (6 days before admission):
- Right frontal headache and retro-orbital pain develops (atypical from usual migraines)

Day -5:
- Morning: Awakens with "gray dot" in inferonasal field of right eye
- Later that day: Intermittent diminished vision in right eye ("white appearing", lasting 45-60 seconds)

Day -3:
- Multiple episodes of vertigo develop (room spinning, ~30 seconds each)
- Intermittent nonpositional bifrontal headaches begin (1-2 times daily)

Day -1:
- Evening: Visits affiliated ophthalmology hospital
- Initial examination reveals visual field defect and mild macular whitening
- Started on low-dose aspirin

Day 0 (Admission):
- Morning: Transfer to main hospital
- Diagnostic workup including blood tests and lumbar puncture
- Admitted to neurology service

Day +1:
- Develops right ear hearing loss and tinnitus
- Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (worse in right ear)

Day +4:
- Fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography performed
- Imaging reveals:
  - Retinal whitening in both eyes
  - Delayed arteriolar filling in right eye
  - Blocked arterioles in left eye
  - Segmental perivascular staining bilaterally

This progression shows a pattern of symptoms that began with headache and visual disturbances, progressed to include vertigo, and finally developed into hearing problems, suggesting a progressive process affecting multiple sensory systems over approximately a 10-day period.
