Let me analyze this case systematically based on the key findings:
Clinical Presentation:

23-year-old woman with history of migraines
New onset atypical headache
Visual symptoms in right eye (scotoma)
Vertigo
Right-sided hearing loss and tinnitus
Vision changes not typical for migraine (no scintillating scotoma or fortification spectra)

Diagnostic Findings:

Retinal Imaging:


Retinal whitening in both eyes
Delayed arteriolar filling on fluorescein angiography
Perivascular staining
Evidence of retinal ischemia


MRI Findings:


Multiple white matter lesions
Corpus callosum lesions
Contrast enhancement of lesions
Perivascular enhancement
Leptomeningeal enhancement
No mass effect
Diffusion restriction patterns


Laboratory Results:


Positive ANA (1:640 with speckled pattern)
Elevated CSF protein (77 mg/dL)
Normal inflammatory markers
Normal coagulation studies

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Susac Syndrome, also known as retinocochleocerebral vasculopathy. This condition is characterized by the clinical triad of:

Branch retinal artery occlusions
Hearing loss
Encephalopathy with characteristic corpus callosum lesions

The diagnosis is supported by:

Young female patient
Characteristic MRI findings in corpus callosum
Retinal arteriolar occlusions on fluorescein angiography
Development of hearing loss
Multiple small vessel involvement
Age and gender typical for this condition

This autoimmune microangiopathy typically affects young women and involves small vessel vasculopathy of the brain, retina, and inner ear, perfectly matching this patient's presentation.
