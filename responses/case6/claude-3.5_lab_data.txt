Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:
Normal Laboratory Values:

Basic Studies


Electrolytes, glucose, glycated hemoglobin
Renal and liver function tests
Complete blood count and differential
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
C-reactive protein
Homocysteine


Coagulation Studies (All Normal)


Prothrombin time
International normalized ratio
Partial-thromboplastin time
Protein S activity
Protein C activity
Antithrombin III activity
Prothrombin G20210A mutation
Activated protein C resistance
Lupus anticoagulant screen

Significant Findings:

Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA)


Positive at 1:640 with speckled pattern
Significance: While suggestive of autoimmune activity, this finding alone wasn't specific enough for diagnosis, as the patient lacked other symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus


Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis


Opening pressure: 13 cm water (normal)
Glucose: 62 mg/dL (normal)
Total protein: 77 mg/dL (elevated; normal range 5-55)
Cell counts: Normal

Nucleated cells: 1/mm³ (normal 0-5)
Red cells: 3/mm³ (normal 0-5)



Clinical Significance:

The normal coagulation studies ruled out:


Hypercoagulable states
Thrombotic disorders
Antiphospholipid syndrome


The normal inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) suggested:


Absence of systemic inflammation
Made conditions like systemic vasculitis less likely


The elevated CSF protein with normal cell counts:


Indicated blood-brain barrier dysfunction
Consistent with microangiopathy
Supported diagnosis of Susac's syndrome


Negative findings helped exclude:


ANCA-associated vasculitis
Antiphospholipid syndrome
Systemic lupus erythematosus (despite positive ANA)
Infection (normal CSF cell counts)

The laboratory findings were most valuable in ruling out other conditions rather than confirming the diagnosis of Susac's syndrome. The diagnosis was ultimately made based on:

Clinical presentation (triad of symptoms)
Imaging findings
Ophthalmologic examination
Pattern of disease progression

This highlights that Susac's syndrome remains primarily a clinical diagnosis supported by imaging and ophthalmologic findings, rather than one based on specific laboratory markers.
