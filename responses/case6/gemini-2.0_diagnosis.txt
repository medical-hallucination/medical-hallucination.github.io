Based on the provided case presentation, lab data, and images, a possible diagnosis is Susac syndrome. The combination of encephalopathy (as shown on the brain MRI with lesions in the corpus callosum, subcortical white matter, and gray matter), branch retinal artery occlusions (as shown on fluorescein angiography and fundus photographs), and sensorineural hearing loss is highly suggestive of Susac syndrome. While other conditions may present with similar symptoms, the combination of these findings, along with the clinical history, makes Susac syndrome a strong possibility.
