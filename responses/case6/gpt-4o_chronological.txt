Here is a chronological ordering of the key events and temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions from the case:

Key Events Chronologically:
6 Days Before Admission:

Right frontal headache and retro-orbital pain began, atypical of prior migraines.
5 Days Before Admission:

Vision alteration occurred in the right eye, described as a "gray dot."
Episodes of intermittent diminished vision ("white appearing") lasting 45-60 seconds.
3 Days Before Admission:

Several episodes of vertigo described as "room spinning" lasting 30 seconds.
Non-positional bifrontal headaches occurred one or two times daily, particularly during screen use.
Persistent gray dot in inferonasal field of the right eye.
Day Before Admission:

Patient visited a specialized ophthalmology hospital due to persistent symptoms.
Day of Admission:

Initial evaluation showed vision loss localized to the right eye and dense depression in the inferonasal field (automated perimetry).
Diagnostic tests revealed no systemic infection, hypercoagulable state, or autoimmune disease other than positive antinuclear antibodies (1:640 speckled pattern).
Hospital Admission:

Low-dose aspirin was administered.
Patient was admitted for further evaluation and neurologic workup.
1 Day After Admission:

Developed hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear, confirmed as bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (worse in the right ear).
4 Days After Admission:

Fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography revealed retinal whitening and delayed filling of retinal arterioles.
Diagnosis:

Susac’s syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical findings and imaging results.
Management:

Initial treatment included intravenous methylprednisolone and high-dose oral prednisone with a taper.
Rituximab was administered weekly for induction therapy.
Maintenance therapy included rituximab and mycophenolate, later switched to azathioprine due to side effects.
Follow-Up:

Surveillance with serial imaging (fluorescein angiography, MRI) and audiometry over months showed no progressive lesions or clinical relapse.
Temporal Relationships:
Symptoms and Diagnosis:

Headache and retro-orbital pain transitioned to vision loss and vertigo, which guided localization to retinal microangiopathy.
Episodic vertigo and hearing loss supported the autoimmune etiology (Susac’s syndrome).
Symptoms and Interventions:

Immediate low-dose aspirin targeted initial vascular protection.
Immunosuppressive therapy aimed to mitigate autoimmune-mediated microangiopathy.
Audiometry and imaging tracked disease progression and response to treatment.
This temporal mapping illustrates the progression from initial symptoms to targeted intervention and ongoing management. Let me know if you need further insights or additional formatting.
