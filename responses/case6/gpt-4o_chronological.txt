Here is the chronological order of the key events along with the temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

### **Chronological Order of Key Events:**
1. **Day -6:**  
   - A right frontal headache and right retro-orbital pain develop.  
   - These symptoms are not typical of the patient’s previous migraines.

2. **Day -5:**  
   - The patient awakens with an alteration in vision described as a "gray dot" in the inferonasal field of the right eye, approximately 6 cm in diameter.  
   - Later in the day, intermittent diminished vision in the right eye occurs, described as "white appearing" episodes lasting 45–60 seconds.  
   - No pain with eye movement, floaters, or scotomata reported.

3. **Day -3:**  
   - Several episodes of vertigo occur, described as "room spinning," lasting about 30 seconds.  
   - Intermittent, nonpositional bifrontal headaches begin, triggered by straining her eyes while using a phone or computer.  
   - The "gray dot" in the vision remains fixed.

4. **Night before admission (Day -1):**  
   - The patient visits an affiliated ophthalmology hospital due to persistent visual-field defects.  

5. **Emergency Department Visit at the Affiliated Hospital (Day 0):**  
   - Ophthalmologic evaluation reveals dense depression in the inferonasal field of the right eye, normal visual acuity (20/20 bilaterally), and mild macular whitening superotemporal to the fovea in the right eye.  
   - Vessels appear normal without emboli or plaques.  

6. **Transfer to this hospital (Day 0):**  
   - The patient reports stable visual-field defects and ongoing intermittent headaches.  
   - Neurologic and general examinations are normal.  
   - Comprehensive laboratory tests and lumbar puncture results are obtained, revealing normal findings except for elevated antinuclear antibodies (1:640, speckled pattern).  
   - Low-dose aspirin is administered, and the patient is admitted to the neurology service.

7. **Day 1 of admission:**  
   - Hearing loss and tinnitus in the right ear develop.  
   - Audiometry reveals bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, more severe in the right ear.

8. **Day 4 of admission:**  
   - Wide-field photographs of the fundus and fluorescein angiography are performed.  
   - Retinal whitening is observed in the right eye, with delayed filling and blockage of arteriolar branches along the superotemporal arcade.  
   - The left eye also shows blocked arterioles in the inferonasal and inferotemporal periphery.

### **Temporal Relationships:**
- **Headache and Vision Changes:** The right frontal headache and retro-orbital pain (Day -6) precede the visual symptoms (Day -5) by one day.  
- **Vertigo and Fixed Gray Dot:** Vertigo episodes (Day -3) occur after the onset of the "gray dot" (Day -5), which remains unchanged.  
- **Hospital Visits:** Visual symptoms and intermittent headaches prompt the first ophthalmologic evaluation the night before admission, followed by transfer to this hospital the next day.  
- **New Symptoms Post-Admission:** Hearing loss and tinnitus develop after admission (Day 1), adding to the earlier symptoms of vision changes and headaches.  
- **Diagnostic Interventions:** Fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography on Day 4 reveal blocked arterioles, correlating with visual-field defects and retinal whitening observed earlier.  

This sequence highlights a progressive neurological and visual syndrome that unfolds over a week and evolves after hospitalization.
