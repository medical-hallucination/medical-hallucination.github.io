Based on the presentation of the case and the findings from the examination and imaging, the patient is likely experiencing Susac's Syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune microangiopathy characterized by a clinical triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO), and sensorineural hearing loss, which correlate with the reported neurological symptoms, retinal findings, and hearing issues.

Key points from the case supporting this diagnosis include:

1. **Retinal Artery Occlusions**: The fluorescein angiography and fundus images reveal branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO) in both eyes.

2. **Hearing Loss**: The patient developed sensorineural hearing loss, notably worse in the right ear.

3. **MRI Findings**: MRI of the head showed lesions in the central portion of the splenium of the corpus callosum and other areas, consistent with findings often seen in Susac's Syndrome.

4. **Clinical Symptoms**: The combination of vision changes, vertigo, hearing loss, headaches, and abnormal MRI findings aligns with this syndrome.

These distinctive features lead to a strong suspicion of Susac's Syndrome, which should be confirmed with further testing and clinical correlation.
