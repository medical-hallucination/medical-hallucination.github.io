Based on the presented case, lab data, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis appears to be Susac Syndrome. Here is the rationale:

Key Features Supporting Susac Syndrome:
Triad of Symptoms:

Vision Loss: Retinal branch artery occlusions noted on fluorescein angiography and retinal whitening observed in fundus photography.
Hearing Loss: Sensorineural hearing loss, particularly in the right ear.
Neurological Symptoms: Vertigo, headaches, and MRI findings suggestive of central nervous system involvement.
MRI Findings:

Hypointense lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Hyperintense lesions on FLAIR imaging with contrast enhancement, consistent with microinfarctions commonly seen in Susac Syndrome.
Fluorescein Angiography:

Demonstrated branch retinal artery occlusions and segmental perivascular staining, hallmark features of Susac Syndrome.
Autoimmune Marker:

Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) at 1:640 with a speckled pattern supports an autoimmune etiology, though other specific markers were negative.
Exclusion of Other Diagnoses:

Lack of evidence for vasculitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, or infectious causes based on laboratory workup.
Susac Syndrome Overview:
Pathophysiology: Autoimmune-mediated microangiopathy affecting the brain, retina, and inner ear.
Typical Population: Young women are commonly affected.
Management: Treatment typically involves immunosuppressive therapy, such as corticosteroids or other immunomodulators, to control the autoimmune process.
Differential Diagnosis:
Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Less likely given the lack of demyelinating plaques and the presence of retinal vascular findings.
Antiphospholipid Syndrome: Ruled out by negative antibody testing.
Central Retinal Artery Occlusion: Does not explain the systemic features like hearing loss and MRI findings.
Further management should focus on confirming the diagnosis through a thorough review of imaging and autoimmune studies, followed by initiating appropriate immunosuppressive therapy.
