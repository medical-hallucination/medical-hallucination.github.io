The laboratory findings in this case provide essential insights into the underlying pathology and help rule out differential diagnoses while supporting the diagnosis of Susac’s syndrome. Here's a detailed analysis:

Key Laboratory Findings and Their Clinical Significance:
Normal Blood Counts and Coagulation Parameters:

Findings: Normal complete blood count (CBC), differential, and coagulation profile (prothrombin time, INR, and partial thromboplastin time).
Significance: This rules out systemic infections, hematologic malignancies, or a hypercoagulable state contributing to retinal and neurologic symptoms. It also excludes conditions like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or other coagulopathies.
Negative Hypercoagulability Panel:

Findings: Normal levels of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin III, along with negative testing for prothrombin G20210A mutation and activated protein C resistance.
Significance: This further excludes inherited or acquired hypercoagulable conditions like antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura as causes of the branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO).
Negative Autoimmune Antibodies, Except for ANA:

Findings: Negative for ANCA, anticardiolipin, and β2-glycoprotein antibodies, but positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) at a titer of 1:640 with a speckled pattern.
Significance:
Positive ANA indicates potential autoimmune involvement, commonly seen in connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or mixed connective tissue disease.
However, the lack of specific antibodies (e.g., dsDNA, Sm antibodies) and the absence of systemic manifestations like rash, renal disease, or arthritis argue against active SLE.
This finding aligns more with Susac’s syndrome, where ANA positivity is a nonspecific marker of immune dysfunction.
Normal Inflammatory Markers:

Findings: Normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Significance: This is notable because many inflammatory or infectious conditions causing retinal vasculitis or BRAO typically elevate these markers. The normal results are consistent with Susac’s syndrome, which is an autoimmune microangiopathy rather than a systemic inflammatory vasculitis.
Lumbar Puncture (CSF Analysis):

Findings:
Colorless cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with normal glucose, mild elevation in protein (77 mg/dL), and normal cell counts (nucleated cells: 1/mm³; red cells: 3/mm³).
Significance:
Mildly elevated CSF protein suggests a breach in the blood-brain barrier, which is consistent with Susac’s syndrome, where microangiopathy can involve the brain.
The absence of pleocytosis or infection-related findings rules out conditions like viral encephalitis, bacterial meningitis, or neurotuberculosis.
Normal Metabolic Panel:

Findings: Normal glucose, glycated hemoglobin, electrolytes, renal function, and liver function.
Significance: This excludes metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus or renal dysfunction as contributors to retinal or neurologic abnormalities.
Fluorescein Angiography Findings:

Findings: Retinal arteriole nonperfusion and perivascular staining.
Significance: Strongly indicative of microvascular occlusion, which, in the absence of systemic vasculitis or embolic sources, points toward Susac’s syndrome.
Correlation with Symptoms:
Vision Loss: The dense inferonasal visual field depression in the right eye correlates with the retinal findings on fluorescein angiography (retinal arteriole occlusion and ischemia). The mild macular whitening observed clinically matches with the branch retinal artery occlusion.

Vertigo and Hearing Loss: Sensorineural hearing loss (confirmed by audiometry) and episodic vertigo are consistent with cochlear microangiopathy in Susac’s syndrome. The laboratory findings rule out systemic vasculitis or embolic sources as causative factors.

Neurological Findings: The mild elevation of CSF protein, along with later MRI findings of corpus callosum lesions, supports central nervous system involvement typical of Susac’s syndrome.

Summary of Clinical Significance:
The laboratory results effectively:

Rule out infectious, hematologic, and hypercoagulable states as alternative diagnoses.
Suggest autoimmune-mediated microangiopathy as the underlying mechanism, consistent with Susac’s syndrome.
Highlight the need for imaging studies (fluorescein angiography and MRI) to confirm microvascular involvement in the retina, cochlea, and brain.
These findings underscore the importance of a thorough diagnostic workup to identify this rare condition and guide immunosuppressive therapy promptly.
