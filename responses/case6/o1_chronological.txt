Below is a day‐by‐day outline of key events, showing when symptoms arose and what interventions occurred in relation to one another. Days are referenced relative to the day of admission (“Day 0” indicates the calendar day of admission to this hospital).

• Day −6 (six days before admission):  
  – New headache in the right frontal and retro-orbital regions, which differed from the patient’s usual migraines.  

• Day −5 (five days before admission):  
  – Upon waking, noticed a “gray dot” in the inferonasal field of the right eye (approximately 6 cm diameter on Amsler grid at 12 in).  
  – Later that day, had intermittent “white appearing” episodes of diminished vision in the right eye lasting 45–60 seconds.  
  – No pain with eye movement, floaters, or typical migraine auras (e.g., scintillating scotomata).  

• Day −3 (three days before admission):  
  – Several episodes of vertigo (lasting ~30 seconds, described as “room spinning,” not provoked by head movement).  
  – Intermittent bifrontal headaches one to two times daily (worse with eye strain on phone or computer).  
  – Persistent “gray dot” in the inferonasal right visual field.  

• Night before admission (Day −1):  
  – Visited an ophthalmology specialty emergency department affiliated with this hospital.  
  – Examination showed dense depression of the inferonasal visual field in the right eye, mild superotemporal macular whitening, and normal intraocular pressures.  

• Day 0 (morning of admission to this hospital):  
  – Transferred for further diagnostic evaluation.  
  – Laboratory studies were largely normal; notable findings included normal vascular risk markers and a positive ANA (1:640 speckled).  
  – Low‐dose aspirin started.  
  – Admitted to the neurology service.  

• Day +1 (one day after admission):  
  – New onset of right‐ear hearing loss and tinnitus.  
  – Audiometry confirmed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (worse in right ear).  

• Day +4 (fourth hospital day):  
  – Color fundus photographs and fluorescein angiography performed.  
  – Imaging revealed retinal‐arteriole filling delays and segmental perivascular staining in both eyes.  

In summary, the initial (atypical) headache predated the visual disturbance by 1 day, and the vertigo began 2 days after the visual symptoms. She sought ophthalmologic care immediately before hospital admission. Low‐dose aspirin was initiated upon admission, and new right‐ear hearing symptoms arose the following day. Fundus imaging studies were done after several days of in‐hospital evaluation.
