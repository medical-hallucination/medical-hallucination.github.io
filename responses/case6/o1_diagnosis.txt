A unifying diagnosis here is Susac’s syndrome, a microangiopathy classically presenting with the triad of

1. Branch retinal artery occlusions (which explains the retinal‐whitening lesions seen on fundus exam and fluorescein angiography),
2. Encephalopathy (MRI lesions in the corpus callosum and subcortical white matter), and
3. Sensorineural hearing loss (her right‐sided hearing loss more prominent than the left).

The combination of bilateral branch retinal artery occlusions, the MRI findings (especially in the corpus callosum), and new‐onset hearing deficits in a young patient with otherwise negative workup strongly supports Susac’s syndrome.
