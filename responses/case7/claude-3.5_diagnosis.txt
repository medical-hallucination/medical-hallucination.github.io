Based on the presented case, the diagnosis is clear: This is a case of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the face with an AR-15 rifle, likely in a suicide attempt. The key findings supporting this diagnosis include:
Clinical History:

37-year-old male
Reportedly upset and drinking alcohol (blood ethanol level 178 mg/dL)
Witnessed self-inflicted gunshot wound
Positive methamphetamine on urine drug screen

Physical Findings:

Extensive facial trauma with:

Entry wound under the chin
Large exit wound in the middle face
Ruptured right globe
Comminuted facial bone fractures
Soft tissue damage from upper lip to nasal radix



Imaging Findings (CT):

Large entry wound under chin
Extensive tissue damage along bullet trajectory
Giant exit wound in mid-face
Comminuted facial bone fractures with fragments extending into intracranial compartment
Pattern consistent with high-velocity gunshot wound

The trajectory (under chin upward) and circumstances are typical of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The extensive tissue damage is characteristic of high-velocity rifles like the AR-15, which create larger temporary cavities than handguns.
Complications/Associated Findings:

Risk of meningitis due to bone fragments in intracranial space
Potential cerebrospinal fluid leak
Respiratory compromise requiring cricothyroidotomy
Globe rupture requiring likely enucleation
Elevated lactate (2.6 mmol/L) suggesting tissue damage/shock

This represents a severe but non-lethal wound as the trajectory missed vital brain structures, though causing devastating facial trauma requiring intensive care management.
