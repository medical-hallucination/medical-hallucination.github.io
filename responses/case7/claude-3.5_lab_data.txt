Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:
Initial Presentation Values (First Hospital):

Hematologic Findings:


Mild anemia (Hb 12.8 g/dL, Hct 36.7%)

Expected due to acute blood loss from facial trauma


Elevated WBC (11,120/mmÂ³) with neutrophilia (81.8%)

Indicates acute inflammatory response to trauma
Could also reflect stress response




Metabolic/Chemistry:


Elevated potassium (5.5 mmol/L)

Could indicate tissue damage or mild renal dysfunction


Elevated chloride (114 mmol/L) and decreased CO2 (19 mmol/L)

Suggests metabolic acidosis


Elevated glucose (182 mg/dL)

Stress response to trauma
Could be affected by alcohol intoxication


Elevated lactate (2.6 mmol/L)

Indicates tissue hypoperfusion
Could be from shock or alcohol effect




Toxicology:


Elevated blood ethanol (178 mg/dL)

Significant intoxication
May have contributed to impaired judgment


Positive urine methamphetamine

Could have influenced mental status
May increase cardiovascular risks



Follow-up Values (MGH):

Worsening anemia:


Hb dropped to 10.5 g/dL
Hct decreased to 31.1%

Suggests ongoing blood loss or dilutional effect from IV fluids




Coagulation:


Elevated PT (15.0 sec) and INR (1.2)

Mild coagulopathy
Could increase bleeding risk
May have contributed to eventual PE formation




Liver Function:


Mildly elevated ALT (57 IU/L) and AST (41 IU/L)

Suggests mild hepatic stress
Could be from alcohol use or hypoperfusion


Low albumin (2.8 g/dL)

Indicates poor nutritional status
Could affect wound healing



Clinical Correlation:

The laboratory findings support multiple pathophysiologic processes:


Acute blood loss and inflammatory response
Metabolic derangements from trauma
Substance use affecting presentation
Developing nutritional compromise during hospital course


These changes increased risk for complications:


Coagulopathy risk for bleeding and thrombosis
Poor nutritional status affecting wound healing
Metabolic acidosis affecting tissue perfusion


The gradual worsening of some parameters (anemia, albumin) suggests ongoing physiologic stress during hospitalization, which may have contributed to the final outcome of pulmonary embolism.

The laboratory findings paint a picture of a complex case with multiple organ systems affected by trauma, substance use, and prolonged hospitalization, all contributing to the patient's clinical course and ultimate outcome.
