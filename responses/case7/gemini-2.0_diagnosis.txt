Based on the provided information, the most likely diagnosis, considering all the findings, would be:

**1. Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound to the Face, Complicated by Multiple Traumatic Injuries:**

This is the primary event that initiated the patient's medical issues. The presentation, clinical photograph, and CT scans all clearly show the trajectory of the bullet, entry and exit wounds, and the extensive damage caused by the high-velocity firearm.

**2. Facial Bone Fractures:**

The CT scans (Fig 2 B, C, E, F) detail extensive comminuted fractures of the facial bones including:
   *   Loss of the mandibular symphysis and left parasymphysis
   *   Fractures of the anterior maxillary alveolar ridge
    * Fractures of the anterior nasal aperture.
    *   Scattered bullet fragments within the wound, paranasal sinuses and right orbit.
   * Severe comminution of the bones of the middle face extending into the intracranial compartment through the cribriform plate and right frontal sinus.

**3. Right Globe Rupture:**

The description and imaging (Fig 2 D) confirm the rupture of the right eye globe due to bullet and bone fragments acting as secondary projectiles.

**4.  Alcohol Intoxication and Methamphetamine Use:**

   *   The patient's blood alcohol level at admission was 178 mg/dL, indicating significant alcohol intoxication.
   *   The urine drug screen was presumptively positive for methamphetamine.

**5.  Metabolic Acidosis:**

   *   Elevated lactic acid (2.6 mmol/L)  suggests metabolic acidosis, likely due to the hypoperfusion from the severe injury and possible hypovolemia.
   *    Low Carbon dioxide (19 mmol/liter) is consistent with acidosis.

**6.  Right main bronchus Intubation:**
    *  The Chest Radiograph showed the ET tube in the right main bronchus.

**7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE):**
   * Autopsy specimens show evidence of both deep vein thrombosis in the left femoral vein with signs of clot attachment and growth (Fig 3 E,F).
   *  Additionally, large thromboemboli were found in the right and left pulmonary arteries (Fig 3 A,B) and evidence of layered fibrin deposition within the thrombus (Fig 3 C). This suggests that DVT and PE occurred secondary to the trauma.

**7. Post-traumatic Inflammatory Response:**

   *   Elevated white blood cell count (11,120 per mm3 initially, then 9840 at the second hospital) and the neutrophil percentage (81.8%) are consistent with an acute inflammatory response to the extensive tissue injury.
   * The lab data from the second hospital shows signs of damage to the liver with elevated ALT (57), AST (41) and Alk phos (43).

**Summary of Diagnoses**

The patient sustained a severe, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the face resulting in:

*   Extensive facial bone fractures.
*   Rupture of the right globe.
*  Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE).
*   Alcohol intoxication and methamphetamine use.
*  Metabolic acidosis and post-traumatic inflammatory response.

It's important to note that this was a complex, multi-system trauma case. The self-inflicted nature of the injury also suggests underlying psychological distress. The lab data from the second hospital also suggests liver damage.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Suicide Attempt:** The location of the injury and the patient's actions strongly suggest a suicide attempt.
*   **Polytrauma:** This was a polytrauma case involving multiple organ systems and requiring immediate life-saving interventions.
*   **Infection Risk:** The open wound, bone fractures, and contamination with bullet fragments pose a significant risk for infection and the possibility of meningitis.
* **Cause of death:** The report mentions autopsy findings, this implies the patient did not survive. This suggests that death was a consequence of the gunshot wound injuries and/or complications like the PE.

This comprehensive list covers the diagnoses that are evident from the case report.
