Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and clinical photograph, the possible diagnosis for this patient includes the following:

Primary Diagnosis:
Self-Inflicted Gunshot Wound (Suicide Attempt):
The description of the injury under the chin, severe facial trauma, and trajectory of the bullet aligns with a suicide attempt using an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.
Associated Conditions and Complications:
Severe Facial Trauma:

Open wound involving the submandibular region, facial bones, and soft tissues, extending from the upper lip to the nasal radix.
Comminuted fractures of the midface bones.
Globe rupture of the right eye.
High-Velocity Ballistic Trauma Effects:

Extensive soft tissue and bony damage caused by the temporary cavity from the AR-15 bullet.
Bullet fragments acting as secondary projectiles.
Hemorrhagic Shock or Hypovolemia:

Hypotension (89/73 mm Hg) on presentation may indicate blood loss secondary to the injury.
Respiratory Compromise:

Initial left-sided absent breath sounds likely due to a hemothorax or pneumothorax.
Misplaced intubation in the right main bronchus, later corrected.
Systemic Findings and Laboratory Abnormalities:

Alcohol Intoxication: Elevated blood ethanol level (178 mg/dl).
Methamphetamine Use: Presumptive positive urine drug screen.
Hyperglycemia: Elevated glucose (182 mg/dl), potentially stress-related or linked to methamphetamine use.
Electrolyte Abnormalities:
Hyperkalemia (5.5 mmol/L).
Hyperchloremia (114 mmol/L).
Low carbon dioxide levels (19 mmol/L), possibly indicating a compensatory respiratory alkalosis or metabolic acidosis.
Lactic Acidosis: Elevated lactic acid (2.6 mmol/L), suggestive of tissue hypoperfusion or systemic stress.
Risk of Infectious Complications:

Disruption of the intracranial compartment raises concern for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage or meningitis.
Trauma-Associated Coagulopathy:

Although initial coagulation studies appear normal, trauma patients remain at risk for consumptive coagulopathy.
Post-Traumatic Psychological Considerations:

Psychiatric evaluation is crucial, given the suicide attempt and possible underlying mental health disorders.
The management would include surgical repair of facial trauma, airway stabilization, infection control, and a multidisciplinary approach involving trauma surgery, ophthalmology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry.
