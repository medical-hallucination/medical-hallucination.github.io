Based on the details provided, the possible diagnoses are:

1. **Complex Facial Trauma**: The patient sustained significant facial injuries involving severe comminution of the facial bones and extensive soft tissue damage, consistent with a high-velocity gunshot wound. Bullet fragments have penetrated various facial structures, resulting in complicated fractures.

2. **Ruptured Globe of the Right Eye**: The gunshot resulted in the rupture of the globe of the right eye, likely due to secondary fragments from the bullet.

3. **Potential Meningitis/Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak**: Due to the comminuted fractures extending into the intracranial compartment, there is a risk of meningitis or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid.

4. **Pulmonary Embolism**: The presence of emboli in the pulmonary artery is evident from the autopsy specimens, suggesting a diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism.

5. **Alcohol and Methamphetamine Intoxication**: The elevated blood ethanol level and positive urine drug screen for methamphetamine indicate acute intoxication.

6. **Metabolic Derangements**: Lab abnormalities such as elevated glucose and lactic acid levels, along with altered sodium, potassium, chloride, and CO2, suggest metabolic derangements potentially owing to stress, trauma, or intoxication.

The overall clinical picture involves extensive traumatic injuries with potential complications, coupled with issues related to substance use.
