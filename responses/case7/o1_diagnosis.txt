Based on all the information—namely the history of a self-inflicted, submental (under the chin) high‐velocity gunshot; the extensive orofacial soft‐tissue and bony destruction evident on clinical exam and imaging; and the laboratory data consistent with acute blood loss, early shock, and traumatic injury—the most fitting single diagnosis is a self-inflicted high-velocity (AR-15) gunshot wound to the face (i.e., a high-energy ballistic injury to the submandibular and midfacial regions). In other words, this is a catastrophic close-range facial gunshot wound that fortunately missed the brain but caused massive oromaxillofacial damage.
