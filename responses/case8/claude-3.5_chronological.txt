Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Age 10:

Patient fractured arm
Underwent tonsillectomy

Age 12:

Experienced adrenarche and thelarche
Had linear growth spurt

Age 16:

Evaluated for primary amenorrhea
Diagnosed with congenital absence of uterus and ovaries

Age 31 (Current Presentation):

Initial Visit:


Referred to fertility center by surrogate parenting agency
Physical exam revealed:

Normal female external genitalia
Normal vaginal length
Absent cervix and uterus
Mild fullness in left adnexal region


Initial tests performed including hormone levels
Blood collected for antimüllerian hormone and chromosomal analysis


Five days later:


Additional hormone tests performed
Bone density scan showed borderline low bone mass


Four days after that:


Diagnostic test results received (revealed 46,XY karyotype)
High antimüllerian hormone level (579 ng/mL)
Additional tests showed elevated testosterone and other hormones


Subsequent Management:


MRI performed showing intra-abdominal testes
Underwent bilateral laparoscopic orchiectomy
Started estrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy
Conceived using oocyte donor and gestational carrier
Ongoing singleton pregnancy at time of case report

The key temporal relationship is that while the patient had early normal female development (thelarche and adrenarche at age 12), she never developed menstruation, leading to the initial workup at age 16. However, the complete diagnosis of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome wasn't made until age 31 when she presented for fertility treatment, leading to comprehensive testing and appropriate management.
