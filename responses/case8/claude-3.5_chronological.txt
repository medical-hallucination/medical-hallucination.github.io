Let me help organize the key events chronologically:

Early Life & Development:
1. Age 10: Arm fracture and tonsillectomy
2. Age ~12: Normal onset of adrenarche, thelarche, and growth spurt
3. Age 16: Evaluated for primary amenorrhea
   - Diagnosed with congenital absence of uterus and ovaries
   - Never experienced menstrual symptoms, headaches, vision problems, galactorrhea, or reduced exercise tolerance

Recent Events (at age 31):
1. 4 months before current evaluation: Moved from northern Europe to New England
2. Initial fertility center visit:
   - Physical examination performed
   - Ultrasound confirmed absent uterus/cervix and revealed ovarian cysts
   - Initial blood tests conducted (infectious disease screening, complete blood count)
   - Blood collected for antim√ºllerian hormone and chromosomal analysis

3. 5 days after initial visit:
   - Additional diagnostic tests performed

4. Further evaluation:
   - DEXA scan showing borderline low bone mass in spine
   - Normal bone mass in vertebral bodies and femoral neck

5. 4 days after DEXA scan:
   - Receipt of diagnostic test result (specific test not identified)
   - Management decisions made

Key Temporal Relationships:
- Normal pubertal development (adrenarche/thelarche) at age 12, but no subsequent menstruation
- 4-year gap between puberty and diagnosis of reproductive tract anomalies
- Current evaluation occurs approximately 15 years after initial diagnosis
- Recent diagnostic workup occurred over a ~9-day period from initial visit to management decisions

Would you like me to analyze any particular aspect of this timeline in more detail?
