Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory data, and imaging findings, this case strongly suggests Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) with Müllerian aplasia. Here's the analysis of key findings that support this diagnosis:
Key Clinical Findings:

Primary amenorrhea
Female phenotype with normal external genitalia
Tall stature (172.7 cm, >90th percentile)
Minimal body hair despite normal male testosterone levels
Absence of uterus and cervix
Normal vagina
Family history notable for healthy twin sister with normal menses

Laboratory and Imaging Evidence:

Hormone Profile:


Elevated luteinizing hormone (25.5 IU/liter)
Very low follicle-stimulating hormone (1.9-2.1 IU/liter)
Estradiol levels consistent with male range (43-49 pg/ml)
Normal prolactin, thyrotropin, and thyroxine levels


MRI Findings:


Absent uterus and cervix
Presence of gonads (testes) in the anterior pelvis
Multiple cysts around the gonads


Pathological Findings:


Testicular tissue with:

Multiple hamartomas
Sertoli cell tubules
Leydig cells
Ovarian-type stroma
Absence of mature spermatogenesis
Presence of adnexal cysts (Müllerian remnants)



The combination of:

Female external phenotype
Male internal gonads (testes)
Absence of Müllerian structures (uterus, cervix)
Normal breast development but minimal body hair
Hormone profile consistent with androgen resistance

All these findings are classic for Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS), a condition caused by complete resistance to androgens due to mutations in the androgen receptor gene, resulting in a female phenotype despite a 46,XY karyotype.
