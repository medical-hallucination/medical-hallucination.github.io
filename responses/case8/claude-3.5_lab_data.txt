Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:

Gonadotropins Pattern:


FSH: Very low (1.9-2.1 IU/L)
LH: Elevated (25.5 IU/L)
Clinical Significance:

This unusual pattern of low FSH with high LH is characteristic of CAIS
The high LH reflects lack of androgen feedback at hypothalamic level due to receptor insensitivity
Low FSH despite high LH suggests active inhibin B feedback from Sertoli cells




Sex Hormones:


Estradiol: 43-49 pg/mL
Progesterone: 1.98-2.15 ng/mL
Total testosterone: 877 ng/dL (markedly elevated)
Clinical Significance:

Testosterone levels in male range but ineffective due to receptor mutation
Adequate estradiol from peripheral aromatization of testosterone allowed normal female secondary sexual development
Explains breast development despite XY karyotype




Key Diagnostic Markers:


Antimüllerian hormone: Markedly elevated (579 ng/mL)
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate: Elevated (692 μg/dL)
Inhibin B: High (496 pg/mL)
Clinical Significance:

High AMH confirms presence of testicular tissue
Elevated inhibin B explains FSH suppression
These findings consistent with functioning testicular tissue




Other Hormones:


Prolactin: Normal (6.4 ng/mL)
Thyrotropin: Normal (1.42 μIU/mL)
Thyroxine: Normal (1.3 ng/dL)
Clinical Significance:

Normal values indicate this is an isolated disorder of sex development
No associated endocrine abnormalities




Bone Health:


Borderline low bone mass (T scores: -1.10, -0.20, -0.90)
Clinical Significance:

Mild bone density reduction despite adequate estrogen
May reflect complex effects of androgen insensitivity on bone metabolism



These laboratory findings explain the patient's clinical presentation:

Female phenotype despite XY karyotype (androgen insensitivity)
Normal breast development (adequate estrogen from aromatization)
Primary amenorrhea (absence of uterus and ovaries)
Minimal body hair (androgen insensitivity)
Tall stature (Y chromosome influence on growth)

The pattern of hormonal findings was crucial in:

Confirming the diagnosis of CAIS
Explaining the mechanism of the patient's sexual development
Guiding appropriate management including gonadectomy and hormone replacement
