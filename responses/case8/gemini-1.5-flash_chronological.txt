## Chronological Order of Key Events

**1. Early Adolescence (Around 12 years old):**
   * Adrenarche and thelarche occurred.
   * Linear growth spurt began.

**2. Late Adolescence (Around 16 years old):**
   * Primary amenorrhea diagnosed.
   * Congenital absence of uterus and ovaries confirmed.

**3. Current Evaluation (31 years old):**
   * Referred to fertility center for family building options.
   * Physical examination, including pelvic exam.
   * Ultrasound of pelvis.
   * Laboratory tests (blood work, viral panel, etc.).
   * Bone mineral density assessment.
   * Additional diagnostic tests (e.g., antimüllerian hormone, karyotype).

**Temporal Relationships:**

* **Early hormonal changes** (adrenarche, thelarche) preceded the **diagnosis of congenital uterine and ovarian absence**.
* **Diagnostic tests and evaluations** were initiated **after the referral** to the fertility center.
* **Bone mineral density assessment** was performed **after the initial blood work**.

**Note:** The specific timing of the additional diagnostic tests (e.g., antimüllerian hormone, karyotype) relative to the initial blood work and bone mineral density assessment is not explicitly stated in the case. However, they were likely ordered and performed within a relatively short timeframe after the initial evaluation.
