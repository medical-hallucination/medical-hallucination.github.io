Here's a chronological ordering of the key events and identification of temporal relationships between symptoms and interventions:

Key Events:

Age 10: Fractured arm and tonsillectomy.
Age 12: Adrenarche and thelarche with linear growth spurt.
Age 16: Evaluation for primary amenorrhea and diagnosis of congenital absence of uterus and ovaries.
Current Age (31): Referred to fertility center for family building with oocyte donor and gestational carrier.
Recent (4 months): Moved to New England from northern Europe.
Recent (4 months): Began smoking 3-5 cigarettes per day.
Recent (4 months): Fertility evaluation and diagnostic tests.
Temporal Relationships:

Symptoms and Interventions:
Primary amenorrhea: Diagnosed at age 16, likely due to congenital absence of uterus and ovaries.
Infertility: Current presentation, related to absence of uterus and ovaries.
Adrenarche and thelarche with linear growth spurt: Occurred at age 12, suggesting normal hormonal function.
Fractured arm and tonsillectomy: Occurred at age 10, unrelated to reproductive health.
Recent move and smoking: May be potential lifestyle factors, but no direct link to reproductive issues is established.
Note: The temporal relationship between the adnexal cysts and the patient's reproductive history is unclear. It's possible they are unrelated, or they may be a consequence of the patient's hormonal status or previous surgical procedures.
