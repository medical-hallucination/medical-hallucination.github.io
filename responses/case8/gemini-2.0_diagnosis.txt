Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and images, the most likely diagnosis is **Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS)**. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

**Key Findings Consistent with CAIS:**

*   **Phenotypic Female with Primary Amenorrhea:** The patient presents as a phenotypic female with normal external genitalia, a normal-length vagina, and no uterus or cervix. She experienced thelarche and adrenarche at a normal age, but has never menstruated.
*   **Absence of Uterus, Cervix, and Ovaries:** The pelvic exam and ultrasound revealed the absence of the uterus and cervix. While initially stated that the patient had an absence of ovaries, the MRI reveals the presence of gonads, and that was confirmed with pathology analysis post-surgery.
*   **Elevated Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Low Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH):** The lab data shows a moderately high LH level (25.5 IU/liter) and very low FSH levels (1.9 to 2.1 IU/liter) which is consistent with gonadal dysgenesis with high levels of LH but not elevated FSH levels, and it's inconsistent with Müllerian agenesis.
*   **Normal Estradiol and Progesterone Levels:** The patient's estradiol and progesterone levels were within normal ranges, albeit at the lower end of the spectrum.
*   **Gonads in Abdomen:** The MRI showed gonads in the anterior pelvis with multiple cysts. These findings are inconsistent with the findings in patients with Mullerian Aplasia
*   **Testicular Histopathology:** The histopathological findings from the orchiectomy specimens show the presence of testicular tissue with seminiferous tubules, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and ovarian-type stroma, all within a fibromatous background.

**Differential Diagnoses and Why They Are Less Likely:**

*   **Müllerian Aplasia (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome – MRKH):**
    *   While MRKH shares the absence of the uterus and cervix, patients typically have *functional* ovaries and normal FSH and LH levels.
    *   In this patient, the absence of ovaries on history is not consistent with MRKH, but now we know they have gonads that are of testicular origin, not ovaries
*   **Gonadal Dysgenesis:**
     *  While this could include a range of chromosomal issues, the combination of the phenotypical female appearance, lack of response to androgen, and specific gonadal histology is most aligned with CAIS.

**Explanation of CAIS:**

*   CAIS is an X-linked recessive disorder in which individuals with a 46,XY karyotype (genetically male) have a mutation in the androgen receptor gene.
*   This leads to a complete lack of response to androgens (like testosterone), despite their production by the testes.
*   The testes develop and secrete testosterone and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). The AMH prevents the development of female internal structures such as the uterus and fallopian tubes. However, because the individual can't respond to androgens, they develop along the female phenotype in terms of external genitalia
*   Affected individuals have normal female external genitalia (due to a lack of androgenization), but internal structures derived from the Müllerian ducts (uterus, cervix, upper vagina) do not develop due to the AMH secretion of the testes. They do not have ovaries.
*   The testicles are typically located in the abdomen or inguinal canal and are often removed to prevent the risk of cancer.
*   The moderately high LH levels are a consequence of the hypothalamus and pituitary trying to stimulate the gonads (testes) to produce hormones. The very low levels of FSH show the relative lack of ovarian activity.

**Additional Considerations from the Text:**

*   The text mentions the patient's tall stature, minimal body hair, normal prolactin and thyroid function, which are all consistent with CAIS.
*   The presence of cysts in the adnexal region is also typical of CAIS.

**In summary**, the combination of clinical presentation, hormonal profile, and pathological findings all point towards a diagnosis of **Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**.
