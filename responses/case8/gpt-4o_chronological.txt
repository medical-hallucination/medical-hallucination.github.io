Key Events in Chronological Order with Temporal Relationships:
Childhood (10 years old):

Event: Fractured arm and underwent tonsillectomy.
Significance: Routine childhood events without relation to current condition.
Early Adolescence (12 years old):

Event: Adrenarche and thelarche occurred, along with a linear growth spurt.
Significance: Suggests normal puberty initiation despite underlying genetic condition.
Mid-Adolescence (16 years old):

Event: Evaluated for primary amenorrhea and diagnosed with congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries.
Significance: Diagnosis marks the first identification of a reproductive anomaly, likely related to the current condition.
Adulthood (31 years old, Present):

Event: Presented with infertility at a fertility center to discuss family building with an oocyte donor and gestational carrier.
Significance: Initiates current diagnostic workup to explore the underlying etiology.
Diagnostic Workup:

Event: Initial blood tests, imaging, and chromosomal analysis revealed:
Absence of the uterus and ovaries, presence of gonads.
Elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.
Chromosomal analysis showed a 46,XY karyotype.
Significance: Confirms suspicion of a disorder of sexual development, narrowing the diagnosis to Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).
Intervention (Pelvic MRI and Pathology):

Event: MRI showed gonads in the pelvis with no follicles and adnexal cysts. Pathological examination of removed gonads revealed Sertoli-cell hamartomas and ovarian-type stroma.
Significance: Confirms the presence of undescended testes with morphological features consistent with CAIS.
Management (Post-Surgery):

Event: Bilateral orchiectomy was performed to mitigate the risk of gonadal malignancy. Estrogen replacement therapy was initiated.
Significance: Addresses cancer risk and supports hormone balance for bone health and secondary sexual characteristics.
Family and Social Disclosure:

Event: The patient decided to disclose her diagnosis to her husband and family after initial reluctance.
Significance: Highlights the psychological impact and familial implications of the diagnosis.
Reproductive Plan:

Event: Proceeded with family building via an oocyte donor and gestational carrier, resulting in an ongoing singleton pregnancy.
Significance: Demonstrates successful navigation of infertility through assisted reproductive technology.
Temporal Relationships:
Puberty-related symptoms (adrenarche and thelarche) occurred normally due to peripheral estrogen conversion, preceding the realization of primary amenorrhea.
The absence of reproductive organs identified at 16 years prompted investigations that established the diagnosis later in adulthood.
Infertility led to further diagnostic clarification (CAIS), culminating in interventions (gonadectomy) and reproductive planning.
Family disclosure and psychosocial counseling were temporally aligned with diagnosis and intervention, addressing psychological and social aspects of the condition.
