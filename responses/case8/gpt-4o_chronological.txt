### Chronological Order of Key Events:

1. **Childhood (Around Age 10):**
   - Fractured arm.
   - Underwent tonsillectomy.

2. **Puberty (Approximately Age 12):**
   - Onset of adrenarche (development of pubic and axillary hair).
   - Onset of thelarche (breast development).
   - Experienced a linear growth spurt.

3. **Adolescence (Age 16):**
   - Evaluated for primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation).
   - Diagnosed with congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries.
   - Did not experience menstrual molimina or other symptoms (e.g., headaches, vision problems, galactorrhea, vasomotor symptoms, or reduced exercise tolerance).

4. **Adulthood (Age 31):**
   - Moved to New England from northern Europe four months prior to the current evaluation.
   - Referred to the fertility center by a surrogate parenting agency for infertility consultation.
   - Medical history revealed a light smoking habit (3–5 cigarettes/day) and no use of illicit drugs.
   - Physical examination noted normal female external genitalia, absence of uterus and cervix, and cysts in the adnexal regions on ultrasonography.

5. **Initial Diagnostic Workup:**
   - Ultrasonography confirmed absence of uterus and cervix.
   - Right ovary not visualized; simple cysts noted bilaterally.
   - Positive antibodies for rubella and varicella–zoster viruses.
   - Negative screening for multiple infections (e.g., hepatitis, HIV, syphilis, cytomegalovirus).
   - Normal complete blood count and differential count.
   - Blood collected for antimüllerian hormone (AMH) level and chromosomal analysis.

6. **Follow-Up Diagnostic Tests (Five Days Later):**
   - Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) showed:
     - Borderline low bone mass in the spine (T score: −1.10).
     - Normal bone mass in the vertebral bodies and femoral neck.

7. **Management Decisions (Four Days After DEXA):**
   - Results from additional diagnostic tests received.
   - Decisions made regarding potential use of an oocyte donor and gestational carrier.

### Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions:

- **Primary Amenorrhea Diagnosed at 16:** Initiated the identification of congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries, but no immediate intervention was pursued at that time. This remained relevant to the current infertility consultation.

- **Borderline Low Bone Mass Identified via DEXA:** Highlighted a potential long-term consequence of the condition or hormonal status, requiring management to mitigate future risks.

- **Infertility Consultation at 31:** Triggered a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including evaluation of reproductive potential and options for family building.

- **Diagnostic Testing and Management:** Sequential diagnostic tests and consultations over a period of weeks informed the final decisions regarding the patient’s treatment and family-building approach.
