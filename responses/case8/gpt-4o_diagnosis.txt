Based on the provided case presentation and supporting data, the possible diagnosis is Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).

Key findings supporting this diagnosis include:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient has primary amenorrhea, absence of a uterus and cervix, but normal female external genitalia and vaginal structure.

2. **Hormonal Findings**: The luteinizing hormone level is moderately high, but follicle-stimulating hormone levels are very low, which is consistent with CAIS where the body is insensitive to androgens.

3. **Physical Examination**: Minimal body hair is noted, which is typical in cases of CAIS due to androgen insensitivity.

4. **Imaging and Pathological Findings**: The presence of testicular tissue (as seen in MRI and orchiectomy specimens) and absence of ovaries supports the diagnosis of CAIS, as the individual is genetically male (46, XY) but phenotypically female due to androgen receptor dysfunction.

5. **Genetic Basis**: Typically, CAIS results from mutations in the androgen receptor gene, leading to normal levels of male hormones that are ineffective due to receptor insensitivity.

These factors together lead to the conclusion of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
