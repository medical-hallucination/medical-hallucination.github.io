Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance:
1. Gonadotropins (FSH and LH):
Findings:

Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 1.9–2.1 IU/L (low).
Luteinizing Hormone (LH): 25.5 IU/L (elevated for a female phenotype).
Clinical Significance:

The combination of low FSH and elevated LH is atypical for a premenopausal woman.
In CAIS: Elevated LH is due to androgen resistance in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, leading to a lack of negative feedback from testosterone.
Low FSH is likely due to inhibin B secretion from the Sertoli cells of the undescended testes, which selectively suppresses FSH secretion.
2. Estradiol:
Findings:

Estradiol: 49–43 pg/mL (normal for a female during the follicular phase).
Clinical Significance:

Normal estradiol levels indicate peripheral conversion of testosterone to estrogen by aromatase, which is sufficient for the development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., breast development and thelarche).
Explains why the patient underwent adrenarche and thelarche despite androgen resistance.
3. Progesterone:
Findings:

Progesterone: 2.15–1.98 ng/mL (within the ovulatory phase range for a typical female).
Clinical Significance:

These levels are unexpected in an individual with no ovarian function.
In CAIS: This may reflect peripheral steroidogenesis from adrenal glands or gonads, as no functional ovaries are present.
4. Prolactin:
Findings:

Prolactin: 6.4 ng/mL (normal).
Clinical Significance:

Normal prolactin rules out pituitary disorders as a cause of primary amenorrhea.
5. Thyrotropin (TSH) and Free Thyroxine (T4):
Findings:

TSH: 1.42 μIU/mL (normal).
Free T4: 1.3 ng/dL (normal).
Clinical Significance:

These findings confirm normal thyroid function, ruling out hypothyroidism as a contributor to symptoms like amenorrhea or low bone mass.
6. Bone Mineral Density (T-scores):
Findings:

Spine T-score: –1.10 (borderline low bone mass).
Vertebral bodies: –0.20 (normal).
Femoral neck: –0.90 (normal).
Clinical Significance:

Borderline low bone density is consistent with hypoestrogenism due to androgen receptor insensitivity. Estrogen plays a key role in maintaining bone density, and hypoestrogenism increases the risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis.
7. Antimüllerian Hormone (AMH):
Findings: Elevated to 579 ng/mL (reference range: 0.9–9.5).
Clinical Significance:
AMH is secreted by Sertoli cells of the undescended testes. This elevated level is diagnostic of a gonadal abnormality, such as testes instead of ovaries, supporting the diagnosis of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).
8. Total Testosterone:
Findings: Markedly elevated to 877 ng/dL (reference range for women: <50 ng/dL).
Clinical Significance:
Elevated testosterone confirms the presence of testes secreting androgens. In CAIS, the androgen receptor defect prevents tissues from responding to testosterone, resulting in a female external phenotype despite high androgen levels.
Summary of Clinical Significance:
The laboratory findings strongly support the diagnosis of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS):

Low FSH and elevated LH are hallmarks of gonadal dysfunction with Sertoli-cell-derived inhibin B and androgen insensitivity.
Elevated estradiol and testosterone reflect functional testicular secretion with aromatase conversion of androgens to estrogens.
AMH and testosterone levels confirm the presence of functioning testicular tissue, consistent with the absence of ovaries and the patient's XY karyotype.
Bone mineral density findings underscore the need for estrogen replacement therapy to prevent further bone loss.
