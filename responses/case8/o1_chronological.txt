Below is a concise summary of the key clinical details in chronological order, highlighting when symptoms arose and when specific diagnostic or management steps were taken.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Childhood (Age 10)
   • Fractured arm and underwent tonsillectomy.
   • No reported gynecologic or endocrine symptoms at this time.

2. Early Adolescence (Approx. Age 12)
   • Onset of adrenarche and thelarche (i.e., development of pubic/axillary hair and breast buds) accompanied by a normal pubertal growth spurt.
   • Despite thelarche (breast development), no subsequent menarche occurred.

3. Mid‐Adolescence (Age 16)
   • Formally evaluated for primary amenorrhea.  
   • Diagnosed with congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries.
   • No history of menstrual molimina, headaches, vision problems, galactorrhea, vasomotor symptoms, or exercise intolerance.

4. Adulthood (Age 31, Four Months Prior to Current Evaluation)
   • Moved from northern Europe to New England with her husband.
   • Smoking history of 3–5 cigarettes/day, rare alcohol use, no illicit drug use.

5. Current Evaluation (Age 31)
   • Referred to the fertility center by a surrogate parenting agency to discuss family building (oocyte donor and gestational carrier).  
   • Physical Exam: 
       – Normal blood pressure, height, weight, and BMI.  
       – Minimal body hair, normal external genitalia, normal vaginal length and rugae.  
       – Absent uterus and cervix; mild left adnexal fullness without discrete mass or tenderness.
   • Pelvic Ultrasonography:
       – Absence of uterus and cervix confirmed.
       – Cystic structures (possible ovarian or tubal cysts) in both adnexal regions.  
   • Initial Laboratory Screening:
       – Positive rubella IgG and varicella–zoster IgG (immune).
       – Negative for hepatitis B, HIV, hepatitis C, HTLV, syphilis, and CMV.
       – CBC with differential normal.
       – Blood collected for antimüllerian hormone (AMH) level and chromosomal analysis.

6. Five Days Later
   • Additional diagnostic testing (referenced in Table 1).  
   • Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) revealed:
       – Borderline low bone mass in the spine (T score −1.10).  
       – Normal bone mass in lateral vertebrae (T score −0.20) and femoral neck (T score −0.90).

7. Four Days After Additional Testing
   • Receipt of a key diagnostic test result (not specified in the excerpt).
   • Management decisions made (e.g., proceeding with specific fertility options, hormonal management, or other interventions).

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SYMPTOMS AND INTERVENTIONS

• Timing of Pubertal Changes vs. Uterine/Ovarian Absence:  
  – Despite normal breast development (thelarche) at ~12 years, the patient never achieved menarche. This discrepancy led to the evaluation at 16 years of age, when testing revealed congenital absence of the uterus and ovaries.

• Lack of Menses Driving Workup:  
  – The absence of menstruation prompted the primary diagnostic evaluation at age 16. By the time she was 31, she remained amenorrheic, confirming a long-standing issue rather than an acute process.

• Fertility Consultation Triggered by Long-Standing Amenorrhea and Uterine Agenesis:  
  – The impetus for further intervention (referral to a fertility center) was her desire to pursue pregnancy options through a surrogate arrangement. This step was not so much in response to new symptoms but rather the planned family-building goal.

• Bone‐Density Monitoring in the Context of Suspected Hypoestrogenic State:  
  – Because of her congenital ovarian absence, the team assessed bone health (DXA scan). Results showed borderline low bone mass in the spine, indicating a need to consider estrogen replacement or other bone-protective strategies.

• Final Diagnostic Confirmation and Management Planning:  
  – Chromosomal analysis and AMH measurement were undertaken to clarify the cause and to guide fertility options (e.g., feasibility of using her own oocytes if any functional ovarian tissue was present) and to formalize a plan for hormone replacement therapy.

In summary, the major interventions—initial fertility consultation, laboratory testing, and bone density assessment—followed chronologically after long‑standing amenorrhea, normal puberty except for absent menses, and the confirmed absence of the uterus and functional ovaries. The impetus for the most recent evaluation was the desire for childbearing, which led to intensified diagnostic workup and eventual management decisions once key test results became available.
