A convenient way to think about this patient’s labs is to ask, “Are these hormone values what one would expect in a typical XX female who is cycling, in an ovarian‐failure picture, or in an individual who may be producing sex steroids from a non‐ovarian source?” Several key points emerge:

1. Elevated LH with Low–Normal FSH.

* LH is moderately elevated at 25.5 IU/L, which is above the usual follicular‐phase range (2.0–15.0 IU/L).
* FSH is low (1.9–2.1 IU/L), which is below the typical follicular‐phase range (3.0–20.0 IU/L).
* In a patient with absent ovaries (or nonfunctional ovarian tissue), one would ordinarily expect both LH and FSH to be quite high (gonadal failure typically removes all negative feedback, so both pituitary gonadotropins climb).
* Here, the LH is high but the FSH is disproportionately low—an unusual combination that suggests there is enough inhibin (or other FSH‐suppressing factor) to keep FSH down, but not enough androgen feedback (or androgen action) to keep LH from rising.

2. Normal‐Range Estradiol.

* The estradiol levels (49 pg/mL and 43 pg/mL) sit comfortably in the low–normal range for a premenopausal woman’s follicular phase.
* Despite the patient’s having been told she lacks ovaries, she is clearly producing (or aromatizing) enough estrogen to maintain breast development and bone density that is only borderline low.

3. Normal Progesterone, Prolactin, and Thyroid Function.

* Progesterone levels (≈2 ng/mL) are at the lower end of a typical luteal‐phase range, but they do not indicate a normal ovulatory cycle (particularly since she lacks a uterus and has never menstruated).
* Normal prolactin, TSH, and free T4 exclude hyperprolactinemia or thyroid disease as causes of amenorrhea.

4. Clinical Correlates:

* Absent uterus and cervix, “ovarian” structures not visualized, minimal body hair, and normal breast development point strongly toward a disorder of sexual development rather than simple Müllerian agenesis.
- Müllerian agenesis (Mayer–Rokitansky–Küster–Hauser syndrome) can explain the absence of uterus/cervix but typically would not account for the incongruent gonadotropin pattern, the apparently functional gonads (producing estrogen), or the markedly minimal body hair.
- Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) fits better: the patient has a 46,XY karyotype, testes that produce normal or high‐normal testosterone (which is aromatized to estradiol → breast development), but tissues cannot respond to androgens → absent or minimal pubic/axillary hair, high LH (due to lack of effective androgen feedback), low–normal FSH (due to inhibin production by the testicular tissue).

** Bottom Line **
Putting the labs together with the clinical picture, the moderately high LH, low FSH, normal‐range estradiol, and minimal body hair are classic for an androgen insensitivity picture rather than simple ovarian failure or Müllerian agenesis. The patient’s “internal” gonads (testes) are functioning well enough to produce inhibin (suppressing FSH) and testosterone (aromatized to estradiol, explaining breast development), but because the androgen receptor is nonfunctional, there is no negative feedback on LH and virtually no masculinizing effects—hence the minimal body hair and the elevated LH level. This explains why, despite her “female” external phenotype, she has never menstruated and was found to have no uterus, cervix, or functioning ovaries.
