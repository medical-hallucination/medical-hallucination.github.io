Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events in this case:
Initial Timeline (Before First Hospital Visit):

Patient starts new OTC pain medication (~5 weeks before admission)
Initial symptoms begin (~3 weeks before admission):

Fevers, chills, headache, diffuse myalgias


5 days later:

Erythematous rash develops (trunk, legs, feet, hands)


1 day after rash:

Abdominal discomfort
Anorexia
Nonbloody diarrhea


Next 5 days:

Positional dizziness with syncope develops



First Hospital Visit (14 days before current admission):

Findings: fatigue, diffuse rash, eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes
Treatment: Unknown antibiotic for 5 days
Discharged with cetirizine and hydroxyzine
Scheduled for PCP follow-up

Day Before Current Admission:

New symptoms: facial and hand swelling, blisters on palms
Sees PCP
Given one dose oral prednisone
Referred to emergency department

Current Hospital Admission:

Day 1: Initial evaluation and admission
Day 2: CT imaging shows lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly
Day 3: Temperature rises to 38.4Â°C
Day 6: PET-CT shows FDG-avid lymph nodes
Day 7: Lymph node biopsy performed

Follow-up:

1 week post-discharge: Persistent periorbital edema, diminishing lymphadenopathy
6 weeks post-discharge: Resolution of most symptoms except dry skin

The temporal sequence shows a pattern typical of DRESS syndrome, with symptoms developing 2-5 weeks after starting a new medication, followed by progressive multi-system involvement and a prolonged course even after discontinuation of the triggering medication.
