Let me create a chronological timeline of the key events:

Approximately 15 weeks before admission:
- Patient begins intentional weight loss (loses 11 kg over this period)

5 weeks before admission:
- Starts new over-the-counter pain medication (name unknown)

3 weeks before admission:
- Initial symptoms appear: fevers, chills, headache, and diffuse myalgias
- Patient assumes it's influenza

2.5 weeks before admission:
- Erythematous rash develops on trunk, legs, feet, and hands
- Following day: Develops abdominal discomfort, anorexia, and nonbloody diarrhea
- Over next 5 days: Experiences positional dizziness with syncope

14 days before admission:
- Seeks care at first hospital
- Findings: fatigue, rash, mild fever (37.7°C), elevated eosinophils, abnormal liver tests
- CT shows lymph node enlargement
- Multiple tests negative (influenza, strep, babesia, ehrlichia, hepatitis, HIV, Lyme)
- Treated with unknown antibiotic
- Discharged after 5 days with cetirizine and hydroxyzine

1 day before admission:
- New symptoms develop: facial and hand swelling, palm blisters
- Seen by primary care physician next day
- Given one dose of oral prednisone
- Referred to emergency department

During admission:
- Day 1: Initial evaluation shows rash progression, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly
- Day 2: CT shows emphysema, pulmonary nodules, enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly
- Day 3: Fever spikes to 38.4°C with tachycardia

Key temporal patterns:
1. Symptoms began about 2 weeks after starting new pain medication
2. Initial flu-like symptoms preceded rash by 5 days
3. GI symptoms and dizziness followed rash development
4. Despite initial hospital treatment, symptoms progressed with new manifestations (blisters, swelling) emerging just before current admission
