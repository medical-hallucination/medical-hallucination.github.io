Let me analyze this case systematically to determine possible diagnoses:
Key Clinical Features:

48-year-old male
Initial symptoms: fever, chills, headache, myalgias
Followed by:

Erythematous rash (trunk, legs, feet, hands)
Abdominal discomfort and diarrhea
Positional dizziness with syncope
Face and hand swelling
Blisters on palms
Lymphadenopathy
Hepatosplenomegaly



Key Laboratory/Imaging Findings:

Elevated eosinophils
Abnormal liver function tests
Lymphadenopathy on CT
Atypical mononuclear cells on blood smear
Splenomegaly
Positive antinuclear antibody
Elevated tryptase
Negative viral studies (HIV, Hepatitis, CMV)

Pattern suggests a systemic hypersensitivity reaction with multi-organ involvement. The most likely diagnoses include:

DRESS Syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms)

Timing (2-6 weeks after drug exposure)
Recent start of new OTC pain medication
Characteristic rash
Eosinophilia
Internal organ involvement
Lymphadenopathy
Fever


Adult-onset Still's disease

Fever
Rash
Lymphadenopathy
Systemic symptoms


Lymphoma with paraneoplastic manifestations

Lymphadenopathy
Constitutional symptoms
Rash
Hepatosplenomegaly



Given the temporal relationship to starting a new medication, multi-system involvement, and characteristic findings, DRESS Syndrome appears to be the most likely diagnosis.
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these differential diagnoses or discuss additional possibilities?
