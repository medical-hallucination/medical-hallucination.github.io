Let me analyze the key laboratory findings and their clinical significance:
Hematologic Abnormalities:

Eosinophilia


Initial count: 600/mm³ (normal 0-200)
Peak: 2530/mm³ (23% of WBC)
Significance: Indicates allergic/hypersensitivity reaction, key diagnostic feature of DRESS syndrome


White Blood Cell Changes


Initial: 18,300/mm³ → Decreased to 6,500/mm³
Atypical lymphocytes: 4% → 13%
Significance: Suggests viral reactivation (HHV-6) and immune response


Anemia and Thrombocytopenia


Hemoglobin dropped: 12.2 → 10.0 g/dL
Platelets: 90,000 → 107,000/mm³
Significance: Potential bone marrow involvement

Liver Function Tests:

Hepatocellular Injury


Elevated AST: 95 → 188 U/L
Elevated ALT: 153 → 160 U/L
Significance: Indicates liver involvement, common in DRESS


Cholestatic Pattern


Elevated alkaline phosphatase: 811 → 498 U/L
γ-Glutamyltransferase: 286 U/L
Significance: Suggests biliary system involvement

Inflammatory Markers:

ESR: 74 mm/hr (normal <10)
CRP: 41.33 mg/L (normal <8)


Significance: Indicates systemic inflammation

Immunologic Findings:

Antinuclear antibody: Initially negative, became positive
Complement levels:


C3: 105 mg/dL (normal)
C4: 15 mg/dL (slightly low)
Significance: Suggests immune system activation

Viral Studies:

HHV-6:


High viral load: 112,836 copies/mL
Elevated IgM and IgG antibodies
Significance: Confirms HHV-6 reactivation/infection

Protein Changes:

Decreased albumin: 2.3 → 2.2 g/dL
Elevated globulin: 4.9 g/dL


Significance: Indicates inflammatory state and possible capillary leak

Clinical Correlation:

The eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, and liver function abnormalities support DRESS syndrome diagnosis
HHV-6 findings explain the mononucleosis-like symptoms
Inflammatory markers correlate with systemic symptoms
Protein changes explain the edema
Sequential changes show progression despite withdrawal of suspected medication, typical of DRESS syndrome

These laboratory findings collectively demonstrate multi-system involvement and support the final diagnosis of DRESS syndrome with associated HHV-6 infection/reactivation.
