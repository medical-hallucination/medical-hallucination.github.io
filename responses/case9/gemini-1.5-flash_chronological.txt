## Chronological Order of Key Events

**Onset of Symptoms:**
1. **3 weeks prior to admission:** Fever, chills, headache, and diffuse myalgias.
2. **8 days prior to admission:** Erythematous rash on trunk, legs, feet, and hands.
3. **7 days prior to admission:** Mild, diffuse abdominal discomfort, anorexia, and non-bloody diarrhea.
4. **5 days prior to admission:** Positional dizziness with syncope.
5. **14 days prior to admission:** Sought medical attention at another hospital.
6. **1 day prior to admission:** New mild swelling of the face and hands, with blisters on the palms.

**Medical Interventions:**
1. **14 days prior to admission:** Treated with an unknown antibiotic and discharged.
2. **1 day prior to admission:** Seen by primary care physician, given oral prednisone, and referred to the emergency department.
3. **Day of admission:** Admitted to the hospital, blood cultures obtained, and peripheral-blood smear revealed atypical-appearing mononuclear cells.
4. **Second hospital day:** CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed.
5. **Third hospital day:** Fever and increased heart rate.

**Temporal Relationships:**
* The rash appeared shortly after the initial flu-like symptoms.
* Abdominal symptoms followed the rash.
* Positional dizziness and syncope occurred a few days after the abdominal symptoms.
* The patient's condition worsened, leading to new skin manifestations and systemic symptoms.
* Medical interventions, including antibiotic treatment and corticosteroid therapy, were initiated but did not fully resolve the patient's condition.

By understanding this timeline, we can better appreciate the progression of the patient's illness and the potential diagnostic considerations.
