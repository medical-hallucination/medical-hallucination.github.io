Based on the information provided, the possible diagnosis for the patient is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis.

Here are the key findings that support this diagnosis:

Clinical Presentation:

Fever, chills, myalgias, diarrhea, and rash
Sinusitis
Pulmonary involvement (bronchial wall thickening, nodules)
Renal involvement (elevated creatinine)
Cutaneous involvement (palpable purpura, bullae)
Systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss)
Laboratory Findings:

Elevated eosinophil count
Elevated liver enzymes
Positive antinuclear antibody (ANA)
Elevated tryptase
Hypergammaglobulinemia
Imaging Findings:

Lymph node enlargement
Splenomegaly
Pulmonary nodules and bronchial wall thickening
While other conditions like drug reaction, infection, or other vasculitides could be considered, the combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings strongly suggests GPA.

It's important to note that a definitive diagnosis of GPA usually requires a tissue biopsy, which can be obtained from the lungs, kidneys, or other affected organs. However, given the high clinical suspicion in this case, treatment for GPA would likely be initiated without a biopsy.
