Based on the presentation of the case, lab data, and images, the most likely diagnosis is **Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome**.

Here's a breakdown of why:

**Clinical Presentation:**

*   **Timing:** Symptoms began approximately 3 weeks before admission.
*   **Systemic Symptoms:** The patient had fever, chills, myalgias, headache, and diarrhea, indicating a systemic process.
*   **Rash:**  The rash is polymorphic, starting as erythematous, progressing to a maculopapular rash, violaceous plaques with exfoliation, and finally, bullae (blisters). The rashâ€™s morphology is quite suggestive of DRESS.
*   **Lymphadenopathy:**  Enlarged lymph nodes were present in multiple locations (cervical, submandibular, axillary, and inguinal).
*   **Organ Involvement:** There is mild abdominal tenderness, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated liver function tests at the time of initial diagnosis which indicates organ involvement.
*  **Pruritus** The patient has been experiencing itching especially around areas where the rash has appeared.
*   **History of New Medication:** The patient reported starting a new over-the-counter medication approximately 5 weeks before symptoms, and then stopping at the onset of symptoms, which highly suggests a drug reaction, in light of all the other findings.

**Laboratory Data:**

*   **Eosinophilia:**  The patient had an absolute eosinophil count of 600/mm3 at the outside hospital and was at 23% on admission, and still at 8% on day 3, consistent with eosinophilia in DRESS.
*   **Atypical Lymphocytes:**  The presence of atypical lymphocytes on the peripheral blood smear.
*   **Elevated Liver Function Tests:**  Elevated AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase levels which signify hepatic injury.
*   **Hypergammaglobulinemia:** Confirmed by serum protein electrophoresis on day 3 which suggests an immune response.
*   **Positive ANA on Day 3** A positive ANA at 1:160 speckled indicates the body is producing autoantibodies and could indicate a drug induced reaction.

**Imaging:**

*   **Lymphadenopathy:** CT scans showing enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, porta hepatis, and other locations.
*   **Splenomegaly:** Enlarged spleen which supports the finding of systemic involvement.
*   **PET scan**: Diffuse increase in FDG uptake throughout the body and spleen which suggests an inflammatory condition.

**RegiSCAR Scoring:**

Based on the scoring criteria, this patient scores 7 points which confirms the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome.

**Excluding Other Possibilities:**

*   **Infection:** The extensive negative infectious workup makes a primary infection less likely.
*   **Autoimmune Disease:** While an ANA is positive on day 3 at 1:160 speckled, the acute presentation, prominent eosinophilia, and strong association with a new medication suggest DRESS is the stronger diagnosis.
*  **Lymphoma**: While the images present with lymphadenopathy, the lymph node biopsy shows a paracortical hyperplasia, which is not typically found in lymphomas.

**Putting It All Together:**

The combination of a recent medication start, the systemic symptoms, a polymorphic rash, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes, liver dysfunction, and other lab findings strongly supports a diagnosis of DRESS syndrome. The RegiSCAR score of 7 further confirms this diagnosis.

**Important Note:**  It is crucial to identify the offending medication to prevent future episodes of DRESS syndrome.
