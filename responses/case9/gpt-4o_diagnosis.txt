Based on the detailed case presentation, lab data, and the clinical photographs provided:

Possible Diagnoses:
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN):

The presence of flaccid bullae and exfoliative plaques, along with systemic symptoms (fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy), points toward a severe drug reaction, possibly triggered by the recently introduced over-the-counter medication.
Erythema Multiforme Major:

This condition could present with a maculopapular rash, bullae, and systemic symptoms. However, it is often associated with a preceding infection or drug exposure.
Adult-Onset Still's Disease (AOSD):

Fever, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and hypergammaglobulinemia could fit this diagnosis. This is a systemic inflammatory disorder that often presents with similar systemic features.
Lymphoma or Leukemia:

The presence of atypical mononuclear cells, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly raises the possibility of an underlying hematologic malignancy.
Hypersensitivity Syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms - DRESS):

The rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and eosinophilia suggest a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction.
Autoimmune Disease (e.g., Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - SLE):

The maculopapular rash, positive ANA test, systemic symptoms, and hypergammaglobulinemia could fit an autoimmune process like SLE.
Additional Testing Needed:
Skin Biopsy: To confirm the diagnosis of a drug reaction or autoimmune blistering disease.
Peripheral Blood Flow Cytometry: To rule out hematologic malignancy.
Viral Serologies: To exclude viral triggers like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Autoimmune Panel: Including double-stranded DNA, complement levels, and specific autoantibodies for SLE.
Drug History Review: To identify potential causative agents.
The combination of clinical features, including systemic symptoms, specific rash patterns, and lab findings, makes hypersensitivity reactions (DRESS) or autoimmune diseases likely. However, further testing and clinical correlation are essential to reach a definitive diagnosis.
