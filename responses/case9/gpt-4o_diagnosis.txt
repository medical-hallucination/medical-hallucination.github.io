Based on the presentation of symptoms, laboratory data, and imaging, the possible diagnosis is Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Clinical Presentation**: 
   - Fever, chills, rash, myalgias, and eosinophilia.
   - The rash is described as diffuse, with violaceous plaques and flaccid bullae, which can be indicative of DRESS.

2. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Eosinophilia is present with an absolute eosinophil count higher than normal.
   - Liver involvement with elevated liver enzyme levels.
   - Atypical lymphocytes seen on peripheral blood smear.
   - Positive EBV IgG and ANA.

3. **Imaging and Physical Exam**:
   - Enlarged lymph nodes, hepatosplenomegaly, and splenic cyst are noted.
   - Periorbital edema and facial rash support the RegiSCAR criteria for DRESS syndrome.

4. **Medications**:
   - Recent use of a new over-the-counter medication, followed by the onset of symptoms, aligns with the typical trigger for DRESS.

5. **RegiSCAR Scoring**:
   - The patient scores 7, placing him in the "definite DRESS syndrome" category.

These findings collectively support DRESS syndrome, a severe drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction, potentially triggered by the recent medication use.
