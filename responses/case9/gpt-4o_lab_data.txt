Analysis of Laboratory Findings and Clinical Significance:
Key Laboratory Findings and Their Clinical Significance:
Eosinophilia (23% on admission, absolute count: 2530/mm³):

Significance: Eosinophilia is a hallmark of hypersensitivity reactions, including DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms).
The presence of eosinophilia correlates with the systemic inflammatory response, particularly affecting the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs.
Atypical Mononuclear Cells:

Significance: Often seen in systemic viral infections (e.g., EBV, CMV, or HHV-6) and hypersensitivity reactions.
In this case, these cells suggest a reactive process triggered by a systemic inflammatory or immune-mediated condition.
Elevated Liver Function Tests:

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 99 U/L (normal: 10–40)
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 116 U/L (normal: 20–60)
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 641 U/L (normal: 30–150)
Significance: Suggests liver involvement, which is common in DRESS syndrome and other systemic conditions with immune dysregulation. These elevations reflect hepatic inflammation or mild damage.
Hypergammaglobulinemia:

Total Protein: 7.5 g/dL (normal: 6.0–8.3)
Albumin: 2.6 g/dL (normal: 3.3–5.0), Globulin: Elevated
Significance: Indicates a systemic inflammatory response with increased immunoglobulin production, which aligns with findings in hypersensitivity or autoimmune processes.
Tryptase Elevated (14.5 ng/mL; normal <11.5):

Significance: Elevated tryptase levels suggest mast cell activation, supporting an allergic or hypersensitivity etiology.
Positive Antinuclear Antibody (ANA):

Positive at 1:40 and 1:160 (speckled pattern).
Significance: Indicates immune system activation but is non-specific. May be seen in autoimmune diseases or hypersensitivity syndromes.
Normal/Inconclusive Viral Markers:

HIV, Hepatitis A, B, C: Negative.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) IgM and CMV antigenemia assay: Negative.
Significance: Rules out viral infections as the primary cause but does not exclude HHV-6 reactivation, which was later confirmed.
Hypoalbuminemia (2.6 g/dL, normal: 3.3–5.0):

Significance: Reflects systemic inflammation and vascular leakage, commonly seen in DRESS syndrome and severe inflammatory states.
Mild Thrombocytopenia (Platelet Count: 111,000/mm³ on admission; normal: 150,000–400,000):

Significance: Suggests a consumptive process, possibly secondary to systemic inflammation or immune activation.
Imaging Correlation:

Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy seen on imaging align with systemic immune activation and inflammation indicated by lab findings.
Integrated Clinical Significance:
The combination of these findings supports a systemic hypersensitivity reaction with immune activation and multiorgan involvement:

Rash, fever, eosinophilia, and elevated liver enzymes point toward DRESS syndrome, most likely triggered by an unknown drug.
Hypergammaglobulinemia and atypical lymphocytes suggest an active immune response, possibly compounded by HHV-6 reactivation.
The lack of significant infectious markers (negative viral studies, normal blood cultures) shifts the focus toward a drug-related etiology.
The involvement of multiple systems (skin, liver, and lymph nodes) reflects the widespread impact of the hypersensitivity response.
Conclusion:
These laboratory findings, in conjunction with the clinical history, strongly indicate DRESS syndrome as the underlying diagnosis. The elevated tryptase, eosinophilia, and systemic inflammation explain the patient’s symptoms and highlight the importance of prompt drug withdrawal and supportive therapy.
