Below is a focused timeline of key clinical events and interventions, starting from approximately five weeks before hospital admission and moving forward, with notes on how symptoms and treatments appear to relate to one another over time.

──────────────────────────────────────────
1. Approximately 5 Weeks before Admission
   • Began a new, over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication (name unknown).  
   • No symptoms reported at this time.

──────────────────────────────────────────
2. Three Weeks (≈21 Days) before Admission
   • Onset of fever, chills, headache, and diffuse myalgias (“flu‐like” symptoms).  
   • Patient subsequently stopped the new OTC pain medication around this time (he reports discontinuing it “at the onset of symptoms”).

──────────────────────────────────────────
3. Five Days after Symptom Onset (≈16 Days before Admission)
   • Diffuse, erythematous rash on trunk, legs, feet, and hands.  
   • Symptoms so far: fever, chills, headache, myalgias, new rash.

──────────────────────────────────────────
4. Six Days after Symptom Onset (≈15 Days before Admission)
   • Mild, diffuse abdominal pain, anorexia, and multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea.  
   • Gastrointestinal symptoms begin shortly after the rash.

──────────────────────────────────────────
5. Through about Eleven Days after Symptom Onset (≈10 Days before Admission)
   • Positional dizziness with syncope over a roughly 5-day span following the onset of abdominal symptoms.  
   • Rash, fever, and GI symptoms continue.

──────────────────────────────────────────
6. Fourteen Days before Admission
   • Sought care at another hospital.  
   • Findings there:  
     – Fatigue, persistent diffuse rash, low-grade fever (37.7°C).  
     – Laboratory tests notable for mild eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count 600/µL) and elevated liver enzymes.  
     – Broad infectious workup (influenza A/B, strep, babesia, ehrlichia, hepatitis panel, HIV p24/antibody, Lyme IgM) negative.  
     – Imaging (CT chest without contrast) showed mild lymphadenopathy up to 9–15 mm.  
   • Intervention:  
     – Treated with an unknown antibiotic.  
     – Discharged after five days with prescriptions for cetirizine and hydroxyzine for pruritus.

──────────────────────────────────────────
7. Nine Days before Admission (Discharge from Other Hospital)
   • Marked the end of the five‐day hospitalization.  
   • Patient instructed to follow up with primary care; continued cetirizine/hydroxyzine.

──────────────────────────────────────────
8. One Day before Current Hospital Admission
   • New mild facial and hand swelling; new blisters on the palms.  
   • Rashes continue, with some bullae forming.

──────────────────────────────────────────
9. Day of Admission
   • Seen by primary care physician (PCP).  
   • Persistent fever, chills, blistering rash, anorexia, and position‐dependent lightheadedness.  
   • Rheumatologist advised giving a single dose of oral prednisone.  
   • Sent to the emergency department (ED) and admitted to this hospital.

──────────────────────────────────────────
10. Hospital Days 2 and 3
   • Hospital Day 2: CT imaging (chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast) showed mild lung changes, multiple lymph nodes, and splenomegaly.  
   • Hospital Day 3: Temperature spike to 38.4°C; tachycardia (HR 110). Additional labs obtained (showing mild diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia), urine and blood cultures drawn.

──────────────────────────────────────────
Temporal Relationships Between Symptoms and Interventions

• The patient began an unknown OTC pain medication about two weeks before his initial systemic symptoms appeared. He stopped it when he became ill, raising the possibility of a drug‐related or hypersensitivity process.  
• Antibiotic therapy given at the first hospital visit (about 14 days prior to admission) did not resolve the rash or systemic complaints and was followed by ongoing rash/bullae formation.  
• Cetirizine and hydroxyzine provided partial symptom control (especially pruritus) but did not halt progression to blistering.  
• One dose of oral prednisone was administered on the day of admission, after the rash had evolved to include bullae on the palms and new swelling of the face and hands.  
• Persistent fevers and rash continued despite these interventions, prompting further investigation and imaging (hospital day 2) and additional cultures (hospital day 3).

This sequence clarifies when new or worsening symptoms arose in relation to each treatment, suggesting that the underlying pathology was not immediately halted by either the antibiotic or the initial antihistamines and that corticosteroid therapy began only after the condition had progressed to bullous lesions.
