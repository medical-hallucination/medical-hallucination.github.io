Putting the entire clinical picture together — the recent introduction of a new medication, the timing of symptom onset, the polymorphous rash with bullae, facial edema, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, liver‐test abnormalities, and negative infectious workup — the most likely diagnosis is DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms).

Key points supporting DRESS include:

1. Typical Timeline. DRESS typically occurs 2–8 weeks after starting a new drug. This patient began an over‐the‐counter medication for pain approximately 5 weeks before his symptoms began.

2. Characteristic Rash and Facial Edema. The photos show a polymorphous eruption with bullae, violaceous plaques, and mild facial swelling — common in DRESS.

3. Eosinophilia and Atypical Lymphocytes. An absolute eosinophil count of 600 per cubic millimeter (above this patient’s local reference range) and atypical lymphocytes on peripheral smear are key hematologic clues.

4. Multiorgan Involvement. Mild hepatitis was evidenced by elevated liver enzymes. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly on imaging add further organ involvement.

5. Exclusion of Infections. A broad infectious panel (including viral, bacterial, and parasitic causes) was negative, guiding the diagnosis away from an occult infection.

6. Lymph Node Biopsy Findings. The node showed “florid paracortical hyperplasia” with Langerhans‐cell expansion and eosinophils, a pattern often called “dermatopathic lymphadenopathy,” which can be associated with severe cutaneous reactions (including DRESS).

Taken together, these features fulfill multiple criteria for DRESS syndrome and best explain the patient’s presentation.
